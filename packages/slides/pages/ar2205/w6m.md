## Fluxus

<!-- 

Less a movement than an innovative matrix of performance and publishing activities aimed at promoting new sorts and events, Fluxus included a wide range of artists working in several nations from around the world.

Events

### fluxus events: between performance and sculpture; the event, unlike early happenings, pivoted on a limited number of actions which were so simple and so closely related to everyday life that they could easily escape notice.
- 
- Fluxus event in Düsseldorf, 1963 . The image shows George Maciunas throwing copies of his manifesto at his audience ( Dick Higgins staged a similar performance in Wiesbaden, the following year)

The single stack of paper, transformed into a flurry of multiple pages, embodying the idea of “#flux” as continual change, and recalled the early #Dada movement, in both its irreverent content and disregard of aesthetic norms.

(Fluxus performances often had a pithy character, especially in contrast to #Kaprow’s “Happenings,” though both sought to blur the line between artist and audience.

<!-- 

- in 1962, Yoko Ono developed a series of textual instruction works which were ultimately collected in her 1964 anthology "Grapefruit".
- Many of Ono's instruction works were realized, but it was not necessary to carry them out physically for the work of art to exist: the text could and often did stand on its own.

_Photograph the canvas at the end of each stanza._

- the composer La Monte Young, a key figure in the development of minimalism, was influenced by Ono's work and incorporated similar concepts of instruction-based art into his compositions.
- they organized series of concerts in Ono's downtown loft, which featured performances by artists such as John Cage and Yoko Ono herself, further blurring the lines between music, performance, and visual art during 1961,

### La Monte Young – Draw A Straight Line & Follow It IV (Composition 1960 #10)
- La Monte Young's "Draw A Straight Line & Follow It IV" is a composition that consists of a single sustained note, which is held for an extended period of time. The piece is designed to explore the concept of duration and the perception of sound over time, and it is often considered a seminal work in the development of minimalism in music.

- Paik performed Young's "Composition 1960 #10" during the Fluxus Internationale Festspiele Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden in 1962, which was a significant event in the history of avant-garde music and performance art. The piece consists of a single sustained note, which is held for an extended period of time, and it is designed to explore the concept of duration and the perception of sound over time. Paik's performance of this piece was notable for its simplicity and its focus on the experience of sound, rather than traditional musical structure or virtuosity.

in 1961, at the Martha Jackson Gallery in NY. A white chair was dramatically lit lie a work of art in the exhibition space, a black chair was placed in the bathroom, and a yellow one outside on the sidewalk. 

Three Chair Events from Water Yam, 1963, by George Brecht, is a series of three performance pieces that involve the use of chairs as props. The events are designed to explore the relationship between the performer and the audience, and they often involve simple actions such as sitting, standing, or moving the chairs in various ways. The pieces are intended to challenge traditional notions of performance and to encourage audience participation and engagement.

- "Event scores function as art by drawing attention to humble objects and simple, though often absurd, actions." (Luci-Smith)

#### Minimalism vs Fluxus

> From one perspective, then, the event, which is premised on causing viewers to perceive their ordinary environments in extraordinary ways, is closely aligned with Minimalism's goal of renewing the innocence of percention. But unlike Minimalist objets which were specially constructed or arranged, event scores pivot on ordinary things like cigarettes and chairs. Art threatens to dissolve into life to a degree not possible with the self-consiously ambigious object of Minimalism. (Luci-Smith)

### Dematerialization ✏️
</div>

<!-- 
- sprituality
- dematerialization of the art object

### libering potential of disappearing things
Ono claimed with Zen philosophy and the mindfulness reslting in "immolation of the things"
Montanez Oritz who ritually destroyed a number of objects, including a sofa and a piano, in orther to release their spirit. He saw destruction as a form of creation in reverse and therefor regarded it as the key to a reenewal of perception. Like Ono, he saw liberatory potential in causing things to disappear. (Luci-Smith)

### dematerialization of the art object

- The 1960s and 1970s witnessed a significant shift in the art world, with many artists embracing the concept of dematerialization, which involved moving away from traditional physical art objects and instead focusing on ideas, concepts, and experiences. This shift was influenced by various factors, including the rise of conceptual art, performance art, and the influence of movements like Fluxus and Minimalism. Artists sought to challenge the notion of art as a tangible object and instead emphasized the importance of the creative process, audience engagement, and the ephemeral nature of art. This led to the creation of works that were often temporary, interactive, or based on instructions rather than physical artifacts.
