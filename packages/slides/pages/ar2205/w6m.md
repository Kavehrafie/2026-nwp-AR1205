Events

### fluxus events: between performance and sculpture; the event, unlike early happenings, pivoted on a limited number of actions which were so simple and so closely related to everyday life that they could easily escape notice.
- 
- Fluxus event in Düsseldorf, 1963 . The image shows George Maciunas throwing copies of his manifesto at his audience ( Dick Higgins staged a similar performance in Wiesbaden, the following year)

The single stack of paper, transformed into a flurry of multiple pages, embodying the idea of “#flux” as continual change, and recalled the early #Dada movement, in both its irreverent content and disregard of aesthetic norms.

(Fluxus performances often had a pithy character, especially in contrast to #Kaprow’s “Happenings,” though both sought to blur the line between artist and audience.

- in 1962, Yoko Ono developed a series of textual instruction works which were ultimately collected in her 1964 anthology "Grapefruit".
- Many of Ono's instruction works were realized, but it was not necessary to carry them out physically for the work of art to exist: the text could and often did stand on its own.

_Make a samll hole in the canvas with a cigarette, hang a sack that_ 

_contains wet cotton and seeds behind the canvas, and water every day._

_The first stanza -- till the canvas is covered by the vine_

_The second stanza -- till the vine withers_

_The third stanza -- till the canvas is burned to ashes_

_Photograph the canvas at the end of each stanza._

- the composer La Monte Young, a key figure in the development of minimalism, was influenced by Ono's work and incorporated similar concepts of instruction-based art into his compositions.
- they organized series of concerts in Ono's downtown loft, which featured performances by artists such as John Cage and Yoko Ono herself, further blurring the lines between music, performance, and visual art during 1961,

### La Monte Young – Draw A Straight Line & Follow It IV (Composition 1960 #10)
- La Monte Young's "Draw A Straight Line & Follow It IV" is a composition that consists of a single sustained note, which is held for an extended period of time. The piece is designed to explore the concept of duration and the perception of sound over time, and it is often considered a seminal work in the development of minimalism in music.
