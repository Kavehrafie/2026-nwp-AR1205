<!-- 

The twenty-eight 'Cubi' sculptures were the last series made by Smith before his death in 1965. They are composed of simple geometric shapes and relate, as the name suggests, to Cubist painting and sculpture. In 'Cubi XIX', and a number of related pieces, the forms on the cross beam are arranged rather like a still life, though elevated by the vertical beam. Smith intended the 'Cubi' works to be shown outside, so that the burnishing of the stainless steel would reflect changes in lighting conditions. The geometric forms were softened by this response to the environment as Smith anticipated in a note on a sketch: 'polished - like I feel if I make square clouds'

- a large, welded steel sculpture that is painted black and stands over 10 feet tall
- the title, Primo Piano, is Italian for 'close-up' and refers to the way the sculpture invites viewers to examine its details and textures up close
- the sculpture is made up of a series of geometric shapes, including cubes, cylinders, and cones, that are arranged in a dynamic composition
- the surface of the sculpture is rough and textured, with visible welds and marks from the fabrication process, which adds to its tactile quality and emphasizes the physicality of the material
- the sculpture is often interpreted as a representation of the human figure, with the various shapes suggesting limbs and body parts, but it is also open to other interpretations and can be seen as an abstract exploration of form and space
- the sculpture is part of a series of works that Smith created in the early 1960s, which marked a shift in his artistic practice towards more abstract and geometric forms, and is considered one of his most important works from this period
- Greenberg wanted them to be painted white, but Smith insisted on black, which he felt would better show the texture of the steel and the marks of the welding process. Then, in 1965, Smith died unexpectedly in a car crash. He was 59 years old, at the peak of his artistic career. Greenberg was named as an executor of his estate, along with artist Robert Motherwell and lawyer Ira Lowe.

If `content` in commercial culture consists of the spectacular rhetoric of packaging and advertising as it was monoumentalized in Pop art, then Minimal objects of the early and mid-1960s sough ... to strip this content away. Minimalism is characterized by three-dimentional geometric forms so basic, and surfaces so ordinary and unadorned, that critics of the time refused to accept them as art.

- a long rectangular beam on the floor (a displaced architectural element or a sculpture)

Like other artists of his generation, Morris pursued an advanced education in art history and earned a Master of Arts degree from Columbia University. Furthermore, Morris was associated with the Judson Dance School, an experimental group of performers who sought to push the conceptual boundaries of dance.

- a large, rectangular mirror mounted on a wooden frame that is painted black and stands on the floor
- the mirror is positioned at an angle, so that it reflects the floor and the viewer's feet when they stand in front of it
- the work is often interpreted as a commentary on the relationship between the viewer and the artwork, as well as the idea of self-reflection and the role of the viewer in the experience of art
- Morris's use of a mirror as a sculptural element was innovative and challenged traditional notions of sculpture as a solid, three-dimensional object. By incorporating a reflective surface, Morris invited viewers to engage with the work in a more interactive and participatory way, encouraging them to see themselves as part of the artwork and to consider their own role in the experience of art. The work is also notable for its use of industrial materials and its emphasis on the relationship between the artwork and its environment, which were important themes in Morris's work and in the broader context of Minimalism and Postminimalism.

<!-- 

Caro first achieved widespread recognition in the early 1960s. He abandoned his earlier, figurative way of working which involved modelling in clay and casting in bronze, and began to make purely abstract works: sculpture constructed and welded in steel, comprising beams, girders and other found elements painted in bright colours. Such works caused a sensation, provoking a response from some critics that these constructions were not sculpture at all

<!-- 

This exhibition, which took place at the Jewish Museum in New York, effectively launched Minimalism into the discourse of contemporary art on the international stage. 

The artists’ work demands “a more total use of our senses,” “allows inventive freedom and intensity of experience beyond the ordinary,” “is an affirmative statement,” “steps into the environment to become another felt presence,” is “an attempt to order in reality the sensations we have of our own physical existence.”

<!-- 

Morris’s Untitled (L-Beams) were shown in the exhibition, “Primary Structures: Younger American and British Sculpture” (April 27 – June 12, 1966).

By placing two eight-foot fiberglass “L-Beams” in a gallery space (often, he showed three), Morris demonstrated that a division existed between our perception of the object and the actual object. While viewers perceived the beams as being different shapes and sizes, in actuality, they were the same shape and of equal size. In direct opposition to Modernism’s focus on the internal syntax of the object, that is, how the object can be understood as something “self-contained,” Morris chose instead to examine the external syntax; the theatricality of the object—the way an object extends out from itself into its environment. In a series of essays written in the late 1960s

### Medium-specificity ✏️
</div>

<!-- 

- medium-specificity: the idea that each art form has its own unique qualities and should be explored and emphasized in order to create the most effective and meaningful works of art. This concept was particularly important in the context of modern art, where artists sought to break away from traditional forms and techniques and explore new possibilities within their chosen medium.

![Donald Judd - exhibition in 1964 at the Green Gallery](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1770653423/2026nwp-ar2205/1_52A_DJ-1963-Green-Gallery-2-1_mwaxar.jpg)

<!-- 

Judd permanently installed a number of the pieces in the exhibition in New York at 101 Spring Street and in Marfa at La Mansana de Chinati/The Block.

Judd's first one-man show was held at the Green Gallery in New York in 1964 after he had abandoned painting for work which took the form of reliefs and free-standing objects. This essay was first published the following year. It is noteworthy for its claim that the representative art of the modern is now neither painting nor sculpture but the Virtual new medium of 'three-dimensional work'. On the question of the legacy of Abstract Expressionism, Judd thus stakes out a position in clear opposition to Greenberg's (as exemplified in Vls7). As a consequence of the forthrightness of his views and the consistently spare style of his work, Judd was identified as a leading figure in the form of apostate Modernism which came to be called Minimalism. This is an identification which Judd himself resisted, however. Despite the concentration of his own sculptural output on a quite restricted range of box-like forms, it is noteworthy that in this early formulation his conception of 'three-dimensional work' is exemplified by reference to a thoroughly heterogeneous range of examples. First published in Arts Yearbook, 8, New York, 1965, pp. 74 -82; reprinted in Judd, Complete Writings 1959-1975, Halifax Nova Scotia, 1975, from which the present text is taken.

Although it is hung on a wall like a painting, Untitled (Stack) projects nearly three feet from the wall and climbs like rungs on a ladder from floor to ceiling. It is made of galvanized iron boxes, all identical and of equal importance. The space around the boxes is also important. The sides are covered with commercially available green lacquer paint typically used to customize Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The tops and bottoms are bare metal. Each of the 12 boxes is nine inches high, and they are spaced nine inches apart. Depending on the height of the ceiling where Untitled (Stack) is displayed, the number of units may be reduced to maintain proper spacing between them. This flexibility reflects the importance of the whole work of art over its individual parts.

Donald Judd ignored traditional craft skills in favor of an overriding system or idea. He wanted his work to suggest an industrial production line. In fact, Judd had his works made in a factory in order to obtain a perfect finish without having to rework the material. The box was one of Judd’s favorite forms, because he felt it was neutral and had no symbolic meaning.

- a series of identical and often readymade units
- in the case of Judd, the works themeselves were fabricated not by the artist but un factories to his specifications, in order to achieve a perfect finish and to avoid the hand of the artist

![Carl Andre. Equivalent V. 1966-69](https://www.moma.org/media/W1siZiIsIjE0NzkyNSJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA5MCAtcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ.jpg?sha=00c271f144eaa08c)

<!-- 

Equivalent V is part of a series of eight sculptures that Andre first exhibited in 1966 at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York. Each of the works is composed of 120 bricks stacked two high and placed directly on the gallery floor. Although the eight works in the series are precise equivalents in many respects (for example, in height, volume, and weight), each is unique in its configuration. Equivalent V is five brick lengths long and twelve brick widths wide, while Equivalent VIII measures ten brick lengths by six brick widths, and so on. By distinctly articulating the shape of each work and executing various permutations with the same materials, Andre proposed that sculpture should define rather than simply occupy space, an idea that has remained important to him throughout his career. 

The Equivalents, Andre’s first flat floor works, dispense with the traditional sculptural pedestal and therefore also eliminate the division between artistic and ordinary space that it implies. The viewer and the sculpture exist in the same field, a fact heightened by the artist’s decision to use unexceptional, factory-made bricks rather than a material associated with fine art, such as bronze or marble. Most of the works in the 1966 series were destroyed. Andre recreated them in 1969 using firebricks, because the original material, sand-lime brick, was no longer available.

Stella's shaped paintings involve several important characteristics of three-dimensional work. The periphery of a piece and the lines inside correspond. The stripes are nowhere near being discrete parts. The surface is farther from the wall than usual, though it remains parallel to it. Since the surface is exceptionally unified and involves little or no space, the parallel plane is unusually distinct. The order is not rationalistic and underlying but is simply order, like that of continuity, one thing after another. <span bg-yellow>A painting isn't an image. The shapes, the unity, projection, order and color are specific, aggressive and powerful.</span>

</div>

<!-- 

Part of Stella's Notched-V series, begun in late 1964, Empress of India comprises four colored chevron-shaped canvases. Stella deliberately avoided dramatic changes in color intensity, because, he reasoned, "when you have four vectored V's moving against each other, if one jumps out, you dislocate the plane and destroy the whole thing entirely." The lines parallel to the canvas edges, painted in metallic browns and ochers, contribute to Stella's perceptual play of pushing parts of the whole forward and back while maintaining an overall equilibrium. Although it is unclear why Stella chose the phrase "Empress of India" for this painting, the grandly scaled work shares the title taken by Queen Victoria when India was incorporated into the British Empire.

Like Judd's Specific Objects and Morris's gestalts or unitary forms, Smith's cube is always of further interest; one never feels that one has come to the end of it; it is inexhaustible. It is inexhaustible, however, not because of any fullness---_that_ is the inexhaustibility of art---but because there is nothing there to exhaust. It is endless the way a road might be, if it were circular, for example.

<!-- 

This is the first of thirty–nine "monuments" to the Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin (1885–1953) that Flavin created between 1964 and 1990. The stepped arrangement of white fluorescent tubes evo_kes Tatlin’s colossal Monument to the Third International_ (1920), a soaring tower intended to support Lenin’s Plan for Monumental Propaganda. Tatlin's ambitious but unrealized project to unite art and technology was of particular interest to Flavin. Although the utopian goals of the Russian Constructivists were never fulfilled, their art and philosophy were of great interest to artists of the 1960s.

- Flavin as an example of California Light and Space artists, who were interested in the perceptual effects of light and color, often using industrial materials like fluorescent tubes to create immersive environments that challenged traditional notions of sculpture and painting.

<!-- 

- Born into a German Jewish family, Hesse was about three years old when her parents left their extended family behind and fled the Nazi regime, arriving in New York City in 1939. 

 She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn (from September 1952 to December 1953), Cooper Union (1954–57), and the School of Art and Architecture at Yale University (B.F.A., 1959), where she studied with artist Josef Albers. After she graduated, Hesse returned to New York City and supported her art by working as a pattern designer for a textile company.

<!-- 

Repetition Nineteen III is composed of 19 translucent, bucket-like forms, each approximately 20 inches tall. Minimalist artists explored serial repetition of identical units, but Hesse loosened that principle. Her forms are handmade and irregular rather than manufactured and hard-edged. They are similar to one another in size and shape, but none of them are exactly alike. Repetition Nineteen III sits directly on the gallery floor. Hesse was flexible about the arrangement of the nineteen units that make up this work. She did not give specific instructions about how her work was to be arranged, so its overall shape varies with each installation.

Hesse used a wide range of materials to make her sculptural works. She was drawn to newly developed materials like fiberglass, which hadn’t been used for sculpture before Hesse began working with it. Aware of the instability of materials like fiberglass, which discolors and deteriorates over time, Hesse said, “Life doesn’t last; art doesn’t last. It doesn’t matter.”

fiberglass: a strong, lightweight material made from fine fibers of glass that are woven together and coated with a resin. It is often used in the construction of boats, cars, and other objects that require durability and resistance to corrosion. In art, fiberglass has been used by artists like Eva Hesse to create sculptures that are both visually striking and conceptually rich.

<!-- 

- Contingent is made up of eight panels, each consisting of a piece of cheesecloth soaked in latex and fiberglass. The panels are hung from the ceiling and allowed to drape and fold in response to gravity, creating a sense of movement and instability. The work is often interpreted as a meditation on the fragility of human existence and the inevitability of change and decay. Hesse's use of unconventional materials and her willingness to embrace impermanence and unpredictability were groundbreaking in the context of Minimalism, which often emphasized permanence and stability.

<!-- 

- **From Minimalism to Postminimalism**: Hesse's work is often seen as a bridge between Minimalism and Postminimalism. While she shared some of the formal concerns of Minimalist artists, such as an interest in seriality and industrial materials, her work also incorporated elements of chance, imperfection, and emotional expression that were more characteristic of Postminimalism. Hesse's willingness to embrace the unpredictable and the ephemeral set her apart from many of her contemporaries and helped to pave the way for a more inclusive and diverse approach to art-making in the decades that followed.

<!-- 
Lynda Benglis's Untitled is made of pigmented polyurethane foam, a material that was new to the art world at the time. The sculpture is characterized by its organic, flowing forms that contrast with the hard-edged geometry of Minimalist works. Benglis's use of color and texture adds to the sensual quality of the piece, which has been interpreted as a feminist response to the male-dominated art world of the 1960s and 1970s. The work challenges traditional notions of sculpture by embracing impermanence and fluidity, and it has been celebrated for its innovative use of materials and its bold, expressive forms.

<!-- 

LeWitt's work emerged alongside the Minimalist and Conceptual art movements of the 1960s, and combines qualities of both. Like the Minimalists, he often uses simple basic forms, in the belief that "using complex basic forms only disrupts the unity of the whole"; like the Conceptualists, he starts with an idea rather than a form, initiating a process that obeys certain rules, and that determines the form by playing itself out. The premise of Serial Project demands the combination and recombination of both open and closed enameled aluminum squares, cubes, and extensions of these shapes, all laid in a grid. Both intricate and methodical, the system produces a visual field that gives its viewers all the evidence they need to unravel its logic.

In a text accompanying Serial Project, LeWitt wrote, "The aim of the artist would not be to instruct the viewer but to give him information. Whether the viewer understands this information is incidental to the artist; he cannot foresee the understanding of all his viewers. He would follow his predetermined premise to its conclusion avoiding subjectivity. Chance, taste, or unconsciously remembered forms would play no part in the outcome. The serial artist does not attempt to produce a beautiful or mysterious object but functions merely as a clerk cataloging the results of his premise."
