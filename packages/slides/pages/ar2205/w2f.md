### Stalin Portrait

The Morning of Our Motherland, 1948, by Fyodor Shurpin is an excellent example of these themes. As Daniel Milnes, former assistant curator of the Haus Der Kunst writes, the painting “depicts a mature and distinguished Stalin with greying hair, seasoned by the trials of war.” Behind Stalin are his life’s achievements. Smoke rises from factories, transmission pylons bear witness to the success of his electrification of the country, and tractors plow the fields. Stalin gazes into the distance, past the viewer, “Shurpin’s image, therefore, not only celebrates industrialization, electrification, and collectivization, but also alludes to the country’s continued development, promising an even brighter future for the Soviet people.”

### individualism
"For many Americans during the Cold War, individuaism--as opposed to totalitarian modes of government associated with fascism and the Stalinist Soviet Union ... the development of a private 'lifestyle' could function as a public act." (Joselit, p. 12)

if individulism was seen as a sign of American values, it was also fostered by the postwar consumer culture.

### Domestic Life in Postwar America Suburbia

<!-- 

the growth of suburbia in the postwar era was closely tied to the rise of consumer culture. The expansion of suburban neighborhoods was fueled by the demand for affordable housing, which in turn created a market for household goods and appliances. As families moved into their new homes, they sought to furnish and decorate them with the latest products, from kitchen appliances to furniture to home entertainment systems.

- Gi Bill: The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the GI Bill, provided returning World War II veterans with benefits that included low-cost mortgages and low-interest loans to buy homes. This legislation played a significant role in the growth of suburban neighborhoods, as it enabled many veterans to purchase homes in newly developed suburban areas.

## Institutionalization of Modernism in the Postwar Era

In the late 1920s, a small group of enterprising patrons of the arts joined forces to create a new museum devoted exclusively to modern art. Establishing a dedicated board of trustees and recruiting the pioneering young scholar Alfred H. Barr, Jr., as founding director, the group created The Museum of Modern Art in 1929. The inaugural exhibition at the Museum featured the work of Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat, and Van Gogh, four of the most celebrated European Post-Impressionist painters. It was met with great enthusiasm: although each artist’s brilliance was well established, it was still rare at the time to see their work exhibited in New York. The exhibition helped to define the Museum’s significant ambitions at its founding as one of first museums of modern and contemporary art in the country.

<!-- 

### "Advancing American Art" (1946-1947)
This is widely considered the U.S. State Department's first major foray into using modern American art as a tool of cultural diplomacy in Europe after WWII.

It featured 117 paintings and prints by 45 artists, focusing on modernist, avant-garde art. It included works by artists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Ben Shahn, Stuart Davis, and William Gropper. The style was decidedly modern and abstract, moving away from traditional realism.

The Tour & First Showing in Europe: After a preview in the U.S., the exhibition began its European tour in 1947. 

Back in the United States, the exhibition became the target of intense criticism from conservative politicians, media figures (like Look magazine), and artists' groups who deemed it "un-American," "communistic," and a waste of taxpayer money

These painters allowed the process of making art to stand as a fundamental aspect of its 'content.' And although in one sense these actions were intensely <u decoration-orange>private</u>, paradoxically they were destined, as works of art, for <u decoration-orange>public sphere</u>.  ... In general, the art of New York School seized upon the most personal and individual psychic material in order to express a shared set of values and experiences.

The method of painting is the natural growth out of a need. I want to express my feelings rather than illustrate them.

Greenberg

<!-- 

For Greenberg the objective of modernist painting was to analyze and express his basic consituent conditions as a medium.

Pollock's emotion transcended the personal to express broader cultural reality.

Pollock, Newman, Rothko, Gottlieb intersted in connecting to and creatinga collective conssciousness through as they believed to be found in Native American art, mythology, and ritual. Symbols like the "zips" of Newman and the "multiforms" of Gottlieb were inspired by Native American motifs. Archytypal themes of creation, destruction, and rebirth were central to their work. Gustav Jung's theories of the collective unconscious and archetypes also influenced these artists, who sought to tap into universal human experiences. Thus they were sometimes referred to as the "mythmakers" of Abstract Expressionism, (they strived to invent a new mythology for the modern age through their art.)

#### allover painting ✏️
</Box>

<!-- 

- By 1947 Pollock had begun to experiment with “allover painting,” a labyrinthine network of lines, splatters, and paint drips from which emerged the great drip or poured paintings of the next few years.

Number 1A, 1948 (fig. 16.8) is an early realization of his
distinctive approach to drip painting. Its intricate web of oil colors mixed with black enamel and aluminum paint asserts and then subverts the viewer’s attempt to interpret the image a sequence of overlapping webs or as a sort of veil obscur-
ing an underlying subject. Thin lines of dripped pigment
commingle with broader strokes and even handprints in the
upper right quadrant, while smudges of red-pink punctu-
ate the lower left portion of the composition, asserting the
possibility of a distinct foreground before dissolving into the
play of colors across the plane of the canvas.

In Pollock’s Number 1A, 1948 one can trace the move-
ments of the artist’s arm, swift and assured, as he deployed
sticks or dried-out brushes to drip paint onto the surface.
His lines are divorced from any descriptive function and
range from string-like thinness to coagulated puddles, all
merging into a hazy, luminous whole that seems to hover
above the picture plane rather than illusionistically behind it. These paintings, generally executed on a large canvas
laid out on the floor, are popularly associated with so-called
Action Painting. It was never the intention of the critic Har-
old Rosenberg, in coining this term, to imply that Action
Painting was limited to a kind of athletic exercise, but rather
that the process of painting was as important as the com-
pleted picture (see Harold Rosenberg’s The American Action
Painters, p. 386). Despite the furious and seemingly hap-
hazard nature of his methods, Pollock’s painting was not a
completely uncontrolled, intuitive act.

- De Kooniing notoriously reworked his paintings, scraping away and repainting areas multiple times until he was satisfied with the result. (Joselit considers this a part of a heroism)
- 1955 he mounted an exhibition titled "Painting on the Theme of the Woman" at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York, featuring a series of six large canvases collectively


- biomorphic abstraction
- slashing paint across the canvas
- tendency to exaggerate breasts, lips, and eyes (cruel and monstrous --- reminding Picasso's beast-like women paintings of the 1930s, , a Surrealist 
femme fatale) for this reason his work was sometimes criticized as misogynistic

### description 

A monumental image of a seated woman in a sundress is his 
repellent and arresting evocation  of woman as sex symbol and fer￾tility goddess. At the same time, the strip of silver metallic paint along the right edge of the can￾vas insists on a decidedly quotid￾ian setting—the aluminum edge  of a screen door, perhaps, or other structure redolent of middle-class comfort—and anchors the sitter in the everyday world.

In painting of New York School, individualism was expressed through an array of distinctive visual styles. However, the particular type of individuality valued in this milieu was heroic emotion and suffering of heterosexual white men who, during the 1940s and 1950s, were unquestionably assumed to represent 'humanity' as a whole.
