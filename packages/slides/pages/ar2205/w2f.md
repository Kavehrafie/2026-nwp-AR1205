## What is High Modernism? ✏️

<!-- 

High Modernism refers to the moment in modern art (roughly late 1940s through the early 1960s) when modernist principles become self‑conscious, purified, and institutionally dominant.
At its core, High Modernism emphasizes:

- Art’s autonomy (art exists for its own internal logic)
- Medium specificity (painting should explore what is unique to painting: flatness, surface, color)
- Formal rigor and reduction
- Universal, timeless claims, often rejecting narrative, representation, and social content

The term is used retrospectively by critics and historians—especially Clement Greenberg—to describe what he saw as modernism reaching its most refined and self‑aware phase.

<!--

### Stalin Portrait

The Morning of Our Motherland, 1948, by Fyodor Shurpin is an excellent example of these themes. As Daniel Milnes, former assistant curator of the Haus Der Kunst writes, the painting “depicts a mature and distinguished Stalin with greying hair, seasoned by the trials of war.” Behind Stalin are his life’s achievements. Smoke rises from factories, transmission pylons bear witness to the success of his electrification of the country, and tractors plow the fields. Stalin gazes into the distance, past the viewer, “Shurpin’s image, therefore, not only celebrates industrialization, electrification, and collectivization, but also alludes to the country’s continued development, promising an even brighter future for the Soviet people.”

### individualism
"For many Americans during the Cold War, individuaism--as opposed to totalitarian modes of government associated with fascism and the Stalinist Soviet Union ... the development of a private 'lifestyle' could function as a public act." (Joselit, p. 12)

if individulism was seen as a sign of American values, it was also fostered by the postwar consumer culture.

<!-- 

the growth of suburbia in the postwar era was closely tied to the rise of consumer culture. The expansion of suburban neighborhoods was fueled by the demand for affordable housing, which in turn created a market for household goods and appliances. As families moved into their new homes, they sought to furnish and decorate them with the latest products, from kitchen appliances to furniture to home entertainment systems.

- Gi Bill: The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, commonly known as the GI Bill, provided returning World War II veterans with benefits that included low-cost mortgages and low-interest loans to buy homes. This legislation played a significant role in the growth of suburban neighborhoods, as it enabled many veterans to purchase homes in newly developed suburban areas.

<!-- 


In the late 1920s, a small group of enterprising patrons of the arts joined forces to create a new museum devoted exclusively to modern art. Establishing a dedicated board of trustees and recruiting the pioneering young scholar Alfred H. Barr, Jr., as founding director, the group created The Museum of Modern Art in 1929. The inaugural exhibition at the Museum featured the work of Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat, and Van Gogh, four of the most celebrated European Post-Impressionist painters. It was met with great enthusiasm: although each artist’s brilliance was well established, it was still rare at the time to see their work exhibited in New York. The exhibition helped to define the Museum’s significant ambitions at its founding as one of first museums of modern and contemporary art in the country.

<!-- 

### "Advancing American Art" (1946-1947)
This is widely considered the U.S. State Department's first major foray into using modern American art as a tool of cultural diplomacy in Europe after WWII.

It featured 117 paintings and prints by 45 artists, focusing on modernist, avant-garde art. It included works by artists like Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Ben Shahn, Stuart Davis, and William Gropper. The style was decidedly modern and abstract, moving away from traditional realism.

The Tour & First Showing in Europe: After a preview in the U.S., the exhibition began its European tour in 1947. 

Back in the United States, the exhibition became the target of intense criticism from conservative politicians, media figures (like Look magazine), and artists' groups who deemed it "un-American," "communistic," and a waste of taxpayer money

Indeed, one often hears <span v-mark.red>Existentialist</span><span v-click="1">✏️</span> echoes in their words, but their "anxiety," their commitment, their "dreadful freedom," concern their work primarily. They defiantly reject the conventional values of the society which surrounds them, but they are not politically engagés even though their paintings have been praised and condemned as symbolic demonstratioons of freedom in a world in which freedom connotes a political attitude.


<!-- 

Existentialism was a philosophical movement that emphasized individual freedom, choice, and responsibility. It emerged in the early 20th century, particularly after World War II, as a response to the disillusionment and uncertainty of the time. Key figures in existentialism include Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Simone de Beauvoir.


These artist also prejoritively labeled "irascible" (easily angered) and "combative" (ready to fight). popularized by the image of difiant arits by Life magazine in 1952

A Film by Hans Namuth of Jackson Pollock Painting (1950) {.text-xs .text-center}

<!-- 
Hans Namuth (1915–1990), a German‑born American photographer and filmmaker.
When?

1950 (with some filming extending into early 1951)

Where?

Pollock’s studio‑barn and the surrounding farm in Springs, East Hampton, New York

It Shaped Pollock’s Public Image
Namuth’s footage cemented the image of Pollock as the archetypal Abstract Expressionist:

the solitary male artist,
working physically and intuitively,
painting as performance.

This visual myth became almost as influential as the paintings themselves.

</div>


<Asterisk />

<!-- 

Within abstract expressionism were two broad groupings: the so-called action painters, who attacked their canvases with expressive brush strokes; and the colour field painters who filled their canvases with large areas of a single colour.

The action painters were led by Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, who worked in a spontaneous improvisatory manner often using large brushes to make sweeping gestural marks. Pollock famously placed his canvas on the ground and danced around it pouring paint from the can or trailing it from the brush or a stick. In this way the action painters directly placed their inner impulses onto the canvas.

The second grouping included Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still. They were deeply interested in religion and myth and created simple compositions with large areas of colour intended to produce a contemplative or meditational response in the viewer. In an essay written in 1948 Barnett Newmann said: 'Instead of making cathedrals out of Christ, man, or ‘'life'’, we are making it out of ourselves, out of our own feelings'. This approach to painting developed from around 1960 into what became known as colour field painting, characterised by artists using large areas of more or less a single flat colour.

<!-- 
 some of the artist's own processes of making the work is re-enacted by the viewer in the realm of perception

- Pollock's drip paintings invite viewers to move around them, experiencing the dynamic energy and rhythm of the composition from different angles. This physical engagement mirrors Pollock's own movements as he created the work, allowing viewers to connect with the artist's process on a sensory level.

The Met acquired this monumental "drip" painting by Pollock in 1957, the year following the artist’s unexpected death—a sign of how quickly his reinvention of painting was accepted into the canon of modern art.

### Regionalism, Social Realism, and Mexican Muralism


<br>

### Indigenous Art 

<!-- 

However revolutionary in technique, Pollock’s large-scale work was rooted in the muralism of the 1930s, including the art of Thomas Hart Benton (see America Today, MMA 2012.478a–j) and David Alfaro Siqueiros, both of whom he had worked alongside.

Navajo sand paintings, Mexican and Native American art, and the calligraphy of East Asian cultures also influenced Pollock’s art.

<!-- 

Pollock, Newman, Rothko, Gottlieb intersted in connecting to and creatinga collective conssciousness through as they believed to be found in Native American art, mythology, and ritual. Symbols like the "zips" of Newman and the "multiforms" of Gottlieb were inspired by Native American motifs. Archytypal themes of creation, destruction, and rebirth were central to their work. Gustav Jung's theories of the collective unconscious and archetypes also influenced these artists, who sought to tap into universal human experiences. Thus they were sometimes referred to as the "mythmakers" of Abstract Expressionism, (they strived to invent a new mythology for the modern age through their art.)

Newman woking as curator and art critic he enstablished analogy between the function of Native American aesthetics and that of the New Yorlk School painters. Working with the gallerist Betty Parsons, he participated in organizing ans writing essays for exhibitions of pre-Columbian and Northwest Coast Indian art in 1944 and 1947 respectively

Pollock possessed several volumes of the Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which contained photographs and descriptions of Native American art and artifacts. 

### Newman on Native American Art

Embodies Newman’s interest in creation, naming, and primal utterance, all closely linked to mythological thinking.
The marks resemble glyphs or inscriptions, without referring to a specific language or culture.
Excellent for discussing abstraction as symbolic speech rather than image.

<!--
Characterizing Onement, I as “the beginning of my present life,” Newman discovered in this breakthrough work a wealth of visual and conceptual complexity. He began by staining a modestly sized canvas with crimson. Over this richly hued ground, he applied a strip of masking tape, and then used a palette knife to scumble over it with cadmium orange. He had originally intended to remove the tape, leaving a lighter strip edged by orange flickers. Instead, he recognized in the vertical line it formed—which he would call a “zip”—a visual device that distilled painting to its essential qualities of space, color, and figure-ground relationship. Newman would spend the rest of his career exploring the potent possibilities of zips on fields of color, creating compositions whose purpose he described in lofty terms: “The image we produce is the self-evident one of revelation…that can be understood by anyone who will look at it without the nostalgic glasses of history.”

The New York art public found that these arts held for them a personal message. The were no longer the historical curiosities of a forgotten people, the crude expression of a primitive, underdeveloped people. Rather, they were the sublime creation of highly sophisticated artists with the same doubts, the same wondering, and the same searching for salvation ... which activates men of spirit of today.

Mitchell painted large, light-filled canvases animated by loosely applied skeins of bright color—here infused with the energy of a large metropolis.

The title suggests a relationship between the painting’s network of pigments and the nerves or arteries of an urban space. The sense of spontaneity conveyed in City Landscape, however, belies Mitchell’s methods. Unlike many of her contemporaries, who were dubbed “action painters,” Mitchell worked slowly and deliberately. “I paint a little,” she said. “Then I sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. Eventually, the painting tells me what to do.”

In painting of New York School, individualism was expressed through an array of distinctive visual styles. However, the particular type of individuality valued in this milieu was heroic emotion and suffering of heterosexual white men who, during the 1940s and 1950s, were unquestionably assumed to represent 'humanity' as a whole.

- **Early Work (Mid-1940s)**
  - Compositions based on classical myths
  - Biomorphic, Surrealist-inspired hybrid creatures
  - Floating in primordial waters

- **Late 1940s Transition**
  - Forms coalesced into floating color shapes
  - Loose, undefined edges within larger expanses of color

- **1949 Breakthrough**
  - Refined and simplified to color rectangles floating on a color ground
  - Thin washes of oil paint with considerable tonal variation
  - Blurred edges to create luminous color effects
  - Shifting, ambiguous space

- **Next Twenty Years**
  - Explored this basic compositional type with infinite and subtle variation
  - Sheer sensuousness of color areas
  - Sense of indefinite outward expansion without central focus
  - Designed to absorb and engulf the spectator

- **Scale**
  - Eventually painted on a huge scale
  - Contributed to the effect of enclosing, encompassing color

- **Late 1950s Shift**
  - Moved away from bright, sensuous color toward deeper, more somber hues
  - Received major commissions for large public spaces
    - Restaurant in the Seagram Building (New York)
    - Dining room at Harvard University
    - Chapel in Houston, Texas (fig. 16.20)

- **Rothko Chapel (1965–66)**
  - Fourteen large panels, almost uniform in deep black and red-brown
  - Designed to be homogeneous with the octagonal building (Philip Johnson, architect)
  - Forms have a less amorphous, harder-edge appearance than earlier abstractions
  - Creates a total architectural–pictorial experience
  - Analogous to religious muralists of the Baroque seventeenth century
  - Adopted the triptych (three-panel) format long associated with religious subjects
  - Intended to provoke emotional and transcendental experiences, not mere formal experiments

- **Late 1960s Darkening**
  - Mood darkened still further
  - Expressed conviction that abstract art could convey "tragedy, ecstasy, and doom"
  - Some have linked this shift to his eventual suicide

Kline's work demonstrates the transition from figurative to abstract painting that characterizes the New York School. His early paintings, such as _Large Clown_ (c.1948), depict the ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky in the role of the puppet Petrushka with expressive, gestural brushwork. By 1950, in _Nijinsky_, Kline had reduced the figure to bold, black calligraphic strokes against a white ground, distilling the movement and energy of the dancer into pure abstract form. This evolution illustrates how Abstract Expressionists often arrived at abstraction through a process of radical simplification of real-world subjects.
