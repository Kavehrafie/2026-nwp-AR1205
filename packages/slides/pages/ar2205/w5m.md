<!-- 
Pop in Japan?

Miki was part of a generation of artists who addressed social and political shifts in Tokyo following the end of World War II and the United States’ occupation of Japan. The human ear became the dominant subject of the artist’s sculptures. Miki often cast his ears in aluminum, as in this work, in which the body part appears in neat rows and at life-size scale. Although the artist once dreamt of being assaulted by hundreds of ears on a train, he denied any symbolism, saying instead: “I can hardly say I chose the ear. More precisely, isn’t it that the ear chose me?”

- began in England in the 1950s according to Lucie-Smith, and grew out of a series of discussions which were held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where artists and critics debated the nature of art and its relationship to popular culture. The term “Pop Art” was coined by Lawrence Alloway, a critic who was part of this group, and it was used to describe the work of artists who were interested in the imagery and themes of popular culture, such as advertising, comic books, and mass media.

### Consumerism and Domesticity and the Cold War

<!-- 
- The Cold War context: Sputnik and the Kitchen Debate

### sputnik: October 4, 1957
- the first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. Its success marked the beginning of the space age and the US-Soviet space race.


### kitchen debate: July 24, 1959
- a series of impromptu exchanges between then U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow. The debate centered around the merits of capitalism versus communism, with Nixon showcasing the modern conveniences of American life, particularly the model kitchen, as a symbol of the benefits of capitalism.

The years following World War II saw enormous growth in the American economy, which, combined with innovations in technology and the media, spawned a consumer culture with more leisure time and expendable income than ever before. The manufacturing industry that had expanded during the war now began to mass-produce everything from hairspray and washing machines to shiny new convertibles, which advertisers claimed all would bring ultimate joy to their owners. Significantly, the development of television, as well as changes in print advertising, placed new emphasis on graphic images and recognizable brand logos—something that we now take for granted in our visually saturated world.

<!-- 
Diner's Club of America, the first credit card, was introduced in 1950. It allowed customers to make purchases at participating merchants and pay for them later, revolutionizing consumer culture and paving the way for the widespread use of credit cards in the decades to come.

- first displayed in the 1956 exhibition "This is Tomorrow" at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London.
- collage features a variety of images cut from popular magazines and advertisements, arranged in a grid-like format. The central figure is a muscular man holding a Tootsie Pop, surrounded by images of consumer goods such as televisions, refrigerators, and cars, as well as images of pin-up; also an stripper with a lampshade on her head

For instance, Hamilton topped his domestic space with a planetary “ceiling”—a view of Earth, which had been photographed using an aerial camera at a height of about 100 miles. (This came from the personal archive of fellow artist McHale, who used collage elements to form images of futuristic, robotic creatures). Its inclusion complicates the sense of scale in Hamilton’s collage, as we move from the intimate space of a residential interior to the expansive realm of the cosmos.

It would be another fifteen years before the publication of the first photograph of Earth in its entirety—the so-called “Blue Marble” captured by the Apollo 17 crew in 1972—but both the Cold War and Space Age were on the horizon, and public fascination with planetary vision was already palpable in popular culture.

### `Culture` is Everywhere

<div v-drag="[25,118,317,281]"  >

"<span bg-yellow> Culture is ordinary: that is the first fact. Every human society has its own shape, its own purposes, its own meanings.</span> Every human society expresses these, in institution, and in arts and learning. The making of a society is the finding of common meanings and directions, and its growth is an active debate and amendment under the pressures of experience, contact, and discovery, writing themselves into the land."

<div text-xs> 
  — Raymond Williams, "Culture is Ordinary," 1958
</div>
</div>

<!--
For instance, the New Left writer Raymond Williams wrote an important essay called “Culture is Ordinary” in 1958, which proposed that we should not think of “culture” as a term that applies only to pursuits of the leisured class.

<!-- 

In contrast to the dripping paint and slashing brushstrokes of Abstract Expressionism—and even of Proto-Pop art—Pop artists applied their paint to imitate the look of industrial printing techniques. This ironic approach is exemplified by Lichtenstein’s methodically painted Ben-Day dots, a mechanical process used to print pulp comics.

As the decade progressed, artists shifted away from painting towards the use of industrial techniques. Warhol began making silkscreens, before removing himself further from the process by having others do the actual printing in his studio, aptly named “The Factory.”  Similarly, Oldenburg abandoned his early installations and performances, to produce the large-scale sculptures of cake slices, lipsticks, and clothespins that he is best known for today.
