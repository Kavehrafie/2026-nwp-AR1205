<!-- 
Pope in Japan?

Miki was part of a generation of artists who addressed social and political shifts in Tokyo following the end of World War II and the United States’ occupation of Japan. The human ear became the dominant subject of the artist’s sculptures. Miki often cast his ears in aluminum, as in this work, in which the body part appears in neat rows and at life-size scale. Although the artist once dreamt of being assaulted by hundreds of ears on a train, he denied any symbolism, saying instead: “I can hardly say I chose the ear. More precisely, isn’t it that the ear chose me?”

- began in England in the 1950s according to Lucie-Smith, and grew out of a series of discussions which were held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where artists and critics debated the nature of art and its relationship to popular culture. The term “Pop Art” was coined by Lawrence Alloway, a critic who was part of this group, and it was used to describe the work of artists who were interested in the imagery and themes of popular culture, such as advertising, comic books, and mass media.

- first displayed in the 1956 exhibition "This is Tomorrow" at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London.
- collage features a variety of images cut from popular magazines and advertisements, arranged in a grid-like format. The central figure is a muscular man holding a Tootsie Pop, surrounded by images of consumer goods such as televisions, refrigerators, and cars, as well as images of pin-up; also an stripper with a lampshade on her head

For instance, Hamilton topped his domestic space with a planetary “ceiling”—a view of Earth, which had been photographed using an aerial camera at a height of about 100 miles. (This came from the personal archive of fellow artist McHale, who used collage elements to form images of futuristic, robotic creatures). Its inclusion complicates the sense of scale in Hamilton’s collage, as we move from the intimate space of a residential interior to the expansive realm of the cosmos.

It would be another fifteen years before the publication of the first photograph of Earth in its entirety—the so-called “Blue Marble” captured by the Apollo 17 crew in 1972—but both the Cold War and Space Age were on the horizon, and public fascination with planetary vision was already palpable in popular culture.

<!-- For instance, the New Left writer Raymond Williams wrote an important essay called “Culture is Ordinary” in 1958, which proposed that we should not think of “culture” as a term that applies only to pursuits of the leisured class.  -->
