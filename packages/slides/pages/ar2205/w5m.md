<!-- 
Pop in Japan?

Miki was part of a generation of artists who addressed social and political shifts in Tokyo following the end of World War II and the United States’ occupation of Japan. The human ear became the dominant subject of the artist’s sculptures. Miki often cast his ears in aluminum, as in this work, in which the body part appears in neat rows and at life-size scale. Although the artist once dreamt of being assaulted by hundreds of ears on a train, he denied any symbolism, saying instead: “I can hardly say I chose the ear. More precisely, isn’t it that the ear chose me?”

- began in England in the 1950s according to Lucie-Smith, and grew out of a series of discussions which were held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where artists and critics debated the nature of art and its relationship to popular culture. The term “Pop Art” was coined by Lawrence Alloway, a critic who was part of this group, and it was used to describe the work of artists who were interested in the imagery and themes of popular culture, such as advertising, comic books, and mass media.

### Consumerism and Domesticity and the Cold War

<!-- 
- The Cold War context: Sputnik and the Kitchen Debate

### sputnik: October 4, 1957
- the first artificial Earth satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. Its success marked the beginning of the space age and the US-Soviet space race.


### kitchen debate: July 24, 1959
- a series of impromptu exchanges between then U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow. The debate centered around the merits of capitalism versus communism, with Nixon showcasing the modern conveniences of American life, particularly the model kitchen, as a symbol of the benefits of capitalism.

The years following World War II saw enormous growth in the American economy, which, combined with innovations in technology and the media, spawned a consumer culture with more leisure time and expendable income than ever before. The manufacturing industry that had expanded during the war now began to mass-produce everything from hairspray and washing machines to shiny new convertibles, which advertisers claimed all would bring ultimate joy to their owners. Significantly, the development of television, as well as changes in print advertising, placed new emphasis on graphic images and recognizable brand logos—something that we now take for granted in our visually saturated world.

- collage features a variety of images cut from popular magazines and advertisements, arranged in a grid-like format. The central figure is a muscular man holding a Tootsie Pop, surrounded by images of consumer goods such as televisions, refrigerators, and cars, as well as images of pin-up; also an stripper with a lampshade on her head

For instance, Hamilton topped his domestic space with a planetary “ceiling”—a view of Earth, which had been photographed using an aerial camera at a height of about 100 miles. (This came from the personal archive of fellow artist McHale, who used collage elements to form images of futuristic, robotic creatures). Its inclusion complicates the sense of scale in Hamilton’s collage, as we move from the intimate space of a residential interior to the expansive realm of the cosmos.

It would be another fifteen years before the publication of the first photograph of Earth in its entirety—the so-called “Blue Marble” captured by the Apollo 17 crew in 1972—but both the Cold War and Space Age were on the horizon, and public fascination with planetary vision was already palpable in popular culture.

<!-- 

No one can talk about European Pop Art without mentioning David Hockney. He is its most prominent representative, even though he moved to the US. He had an eccentric appearance and was associated with the Beatles. Hockney’s first paintings were influenced by Francis Bacon. Later he found his personal style. Hockney painted in strong and intense color combinations on big, flat surfaces. His works were related to his own sexual experiences. By 1964, he was already living in California, where he made references to famous Hollywood stars and their luxurious way of living.


Hockney’s most famous works are his pool paintings. They are characterized by the use of bright colors and geometric shapes. The water in the pool is depicted with a mosaic of blue and green shapes, creating a sense of movement and depth. The figures in the paintings are often shown in relaxed poses, enjoying the sun and water. Hockney’s pool paintings are seen as a celebration of leisure and luxury, as well as a reflection of the California lifestyle.

### Pop Art in America
- Andy Warhol (1928–1987)
- Roy Lichtenstein (1923–1997)
- Claes Oldenburg (b. 1929)
- James Rosenquist (1933–2017)
- Tom Wesselmann (1931–2004)
- Robert Rauschenberg (1925–2008) (Neo-Dada)
- Jasper Johns (b. 1930) (Neo-Dada)

:: content ::

<!-- 
- In the United States, Pop Art emerged in the late 1950s and early 1960s, with artists like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, and Tom Wesselmann leading the movement. These artists drew inspiration from popular culture, including advertising, comic books, and mass media, to create works that often featured bold colors, graphic imagery, and a sense of irony () or satire.
- 
- 
#### irony: 
Postmodern irony is a defining feature of postmodernism, characterized by a self-aware, playful, and often contradictory approach that challenges grand narratives, ideologies, and traditional storytelling.  It reflects skepticism toward absolute truths, using parody, pastiche, metafiction, and black humor to highlight the constructed nature of meaning and reality.  This form of irony often presents serious themes in a lighthearted or comical way, blurring the line between sincerity and mockery.

<!-- 
- oldenburg began his career in the early 1960s with a series of installations and performances that he called “happenings.” These were often staged in public spaces, such as storefronts or parks, and involved the use of everyday objects and materials. For instance, in his 1961 installation “The Store,” Oldenburg filled a storefront with a variety of objects, including a giant hamburger, a pair of scissors, and a toilet. The installation was meant to be interactive, with visitors encouraged to touch and manipulate the objects.

<!-- 

In contrast to the dripping paint and slashing brushstrokes of Abstract Expressionism—and even of Proto-Pop art—Pop artists applied their paint to imitate the look of industrial printing techniques. This ironic approach is exemplified by Lichtenstein’s methodically painted Ben-Day dots, a mechanical process used to print pulp comics.

As the decade progressed, artists shifted away from painting towards the use of industrial techniques. Warhol began making silkscreens, before removing himself further from the process by having others do the actual printing in his studio, aptly named “The Factory.”  Similarly, Oldenburg abandoned his early installations and performances, to produce the large-scale sculptures of cake slices, lipsticks, and clothespins that he is best known for today.

<!-- 
- Lichtenstein's "Whaam!" is a diptych painting that depicts a fighter plane shooting down an enemy aircraft, rendered in the style of a comic book. The painting is characterized by its bold colors, graphic imagery, and use of Ben-Day dots, which were commonly used in comic book printing to create shading and texture. The work is meant to be a commentary on the glorification of war and violence in popular culture, as well as a critique of traditional notions of art and beauty.

</div>

<!-- 

- Silkscreen printing, also known as screen printing or serigraphy, is a printing technique that involves creating a stencil (or screen) and using it to apply ink onto a surface, such as paper, fabric, or canvas. The process involves several steps:
1. Creating the stencil: A mesh screen is stretched over a frame, and a stencil is created by blocking out areas of the screen with a light-sensitive emulsion or other materials.
2. Preparing the ink: Ink is prepared in the desired color and consistency.
3. Setting up the screen: The screen is placed over the surface to be printed, and the ink is applied to the top of the screen.
4. Printing: A squeegee is used to press the ink through the mesh screen and onto the surface below, creating the desired image.
5. Drying: The printed surface is allowed to dry before additional colors or layers are added.
6. Cleaning: The screen is cleaned and prepared for future use.

The Factory was pop artist Andy Warhol's New York City studio and the center of his artistic, social, and filmmaking activities from 1964 to 1987. 

- The Factory was known for its eclectic mix of artists, musicians, actors, and socialites who gathered there to collaborate and socialize. It was a hub of creativity and experimentation, where Warhol produced many of his most famous works, including his silkscreen prints of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley.

<!-- 

Green Coca-Cola Bottles was created the year that Andy Warhol developed his pioneering silkscreen technique, which allowed him to produce his paintings through a mechanical process that paralleled his use of mass culture subjects. Here, the image of a single Coca-Cola bottle is repeated in regular rows, seven high by sixteen across, above the company’s logo. The repetitive imagery and standardized format evokes the look of mechanical reproduction, but the black outlines were probably stamped by hand from a single carved woodblock onto green areas printed in a grid pattern. This engenders subtle differences in the work’s pattern; each of the bottles differs in both the evenness of the green underpainting and in the clarity of its stamped profile. The bottles are also often slightly askew, disturbing the overall regularity of the grid and making them appear simultaneously handmade and individualized, streamlined and mass-produced. In his deadpan and ironic way, Warhol at once criticized and glorified the consumerist idols and surface values of America’s media-saturated postwar culture. “A Coke is a Coke,” he explained, “and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.”

### "What in the end makes the difference between a Brillo box and a work of art consisting of a Brillo box is a certain theory of art. It is theory that takes it up into the world of art, and keeps it from collapsing into the real object which it is.\[Warhol’s Brillo boxes\] could not have been art fifty years ago. The world has to be ready for certain things, the artworld no less than the real one. It is the role of artistic theories, these days as always, to make the artworld, and art, possible."

<!-- 

literalism: a term used to describe the approach of artists who create works that are meant to be taken at face value, without any deeper symbolic or metaphorical meaning. In the context of Pop Art, literalism refers to the way that artists like Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein created works that were meant to be read as straightforward representations of popular culture, rather than as complex or layered works of art. This approach was often seen as a critique of traditional notions of art and beauty, as well as a commentary on the role of advertising and mass media in shaping our perceptions of the world around us.
