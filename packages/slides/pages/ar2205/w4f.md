  - Minimalist work consisting of four white canvases
  - Emphasizes the concept of "nothingness" and the role of light and shadow

![Robert Rauschenberg, _Bed_, 1955](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1770050002/2026nwp-ar2205/W1siZiIsIjUyNzIzNSJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA5MCAtcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ_t8m5qb.jpg)

<!-- 
Bed is one of Robert Rauschenberg’s first combines, a term he coined to describe the works resulting from his technique of attaching found objects to a traditional canvas support. 
 
In this work, however, there is no canvas. The artist took a well-worn pillow, sheet, and quilt, scribbled on them with pencil, splashed them with paint in a style similar to Jackson Pollock’s action paintings, and hung the entire ensemble on the wall.

Rauschenberg used his own bedding (and a quilt from Dorothea Rockburne) to make Bed, because he could not afford to buy a new canvas. “It was very simply put together, because I actually had nothing to paint on,” he reflected years later. “Except it was summertime, it was hot, so I didn’t need the quilt. So the quilt was, I thought, abstracted. But it wasn’t abstracted enough, so that no matter what I did to it, it kept saying, ‘I’m a bed.’ So, finally I gave in and I gave it a pillow.”

Hung on the wall like a traditional painting, his bed becomes a sort of intimate self-portrait consistent with his assertion that “painting relates to both art and life…I try to act in that gap between the two.”

<!-- 

- Automobile Tire Print (1953) records one of Robert Rauschenberg’s most intriguing collaborative efforts. In 1953, the artist directed composer John Cage (1912–1992) to drive his Model A Ford in a straight line over twenty sheets of paper that Rauschenberg had glued together and laid in the road outside his Fulton Street studio in Lower Manhattan. The car’s front tire left a faint embossed impression, while the rear tire, which had passed through a pool of paint Rauschenberg had poured in the street, deposited a juicy black tread mark that stretches in a diminishing line along the twenty-two-foot length of paper. 
- Over the years, Automobile Tire Print has been interpreted as a monoprint, a drawing, a performance, a process piece, and a distinctive exploration of indexical mark making. In its serial imagery (it records nearly three revolutions of Cage’s wheel)

- Like Rauschenberg’s Erased de Kooning Drawing, which was also created in fall 1953, Automobile Tire Print challenges traditional understandings of art and authorship.

<!-- 

- In 1953, Rauschenberg created one of his most famous works, Erased de Kooning Drawing, by taking a drawing by Willem de Kooning and erasing it. 
- Rauschenberg sought and received de Kooning’s permission to erase one of his drawings, which he did over the course of a month, using a variety of erasers. The result is a nearly blank sheet of paper, bearing only faint traces of the original drawing. Rauschenberg mounted the erased drawing on a backing board and framed it, adding the title and his signature to the lower edge.
- The work challenges traditional notions of art and authorship, as it raises questions about the value of the erased drawing and the act of erasure itself as a creative process.

</div>

<!-- 

Black Mountain College was an experiment in progressive education that brought together creative minds from all over the globe to the rural Swannanoa Valley of Black Mountain, North Carolina. As a liberal arts school, the College was short-lived, opening in 1933 and closing by 1957 due to financial struggles and other structural challenges. 


Some of the worlds greatest modern artists, writers, performers, musicians, and even scientists served as students and faculty at Black Mountain College, including Josef & Anni Albers, Charles Olsen, Merce Cunningham, Robert Rauschenberg, Willem & Elaine de Kooning, Buckminster Fuller, M.C. Richards, and many others.

![Untitled (Soap Bubble Set)Date:
c. 1957

Artist:
Joseph Cornell](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1770030554/2026nwp-ar2205/Screenshot_2026-02-02_030843_jp4vda.png)

<!-- 

Soap bubble sets were among Cornell’s earliest imaginary constructions, going back to his contribution to the 1936–37 exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. This box forms an interesting contrast with the other Soap Bubble Set in the Bergman collection (see Soap Bubble Set). Here the bold form of the moon fills the back panel, its pitted surface finding an echo in the cork ball suspended on the parallel rods. Like the earlier box, this one includes a drinking glass. A clay pipe lying on the floor of the box forges the link between the “bubbles” and the planets. Cornell seems to wish to counteract, however, the obviously poetic, dreamlike connotations of this box by emphasizing the scientific interest of the moon through its precisely “mapped” surface and the tables with astronomical data pasted in at the left and right.
