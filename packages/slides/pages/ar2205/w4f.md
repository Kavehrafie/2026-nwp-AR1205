<!-- 
 Gutai (具体, "concreteness" or "materiality") was an avant-garde art movement that originated in Japan in the 1950s. The movement was characterized by its emphasis on the physical properties of materials and the use of unconventional techniques to create art.

A misreading 

### Saburo Murakami, At One Moment Opening Six Holes, October 1955
- Performance art piece
- Murakami burst through six paper screens with his body
- Emphasized the physicality of the body and the materiality of paper
- Explored the relationship between the body and space
- Challenged traditional notions of art and performance
  
### Shiraga Kazuo, Challenging Mud (Doro ni idomu), 1955 (2nd execution)
- Performance art piece
- Shiraga covered himself in mud and wrestled with it
- Explored the relationship between the body and nature
- Emphasized the physicality of the body and the materiality of mud
- Challenged traditional notions of art and performance
- Shiraga performed his body/mud composition in the front courtyard of Tokyo’s Ohara Hall three times over the run of the first Gutai Art Exhibition. The photographs that survive record the different effects of each iteration of the performance. Each time Shiraga molded, smeared, and grappled with a different combination of cement, kabetsuchi, and aggregates such as sand and gravel. Somewhere between painting, sculpting, and wrestling, Kazuo’s radical actions defied categorical boundaries.

<!-- 
On returning to Milan in 1948, Fontana embarked on his Concetto spaziale (‘spatial concept’) series, which became signature — layered, monochromatic canvases riddled with buchi (holes) and tagli (cuts), the deep lacerations in the canvases revealing a dark ground within.

Complementing them are series of monochrome ceramics, their surfaces brutally slashed and punctured. Evocative of lunar landscapes, they too are at once rugged and serene.

- Lucio Fontana, Concetto spaziale, 1960
  - Monochromatic canvas with slashes
  - Explores the concept of space and dimension
  - Challenges traditional notions of painting and sculpture

Fontana’s slashed canvases and pierced ceramics are radical interventions into the traditional mediums of painting and sculpture. By cutting into the surface of the canvas or ceramic, Fontana disrupts the flatness of the picture plane and introduces a new dimension of space and depth. The cuts and holes create a sense of movement and dynamism, as if the artwork is alive and in motion.

Strokes, smears, lines, dots, etc. became less and less attached to representing objects and existed more and more on their own, self-sufficiently.

Objects of every sort are materials for the new art: paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, smoke, water, old socks, a dog, movies, a thousand other things which will be discovered by the present generation of artists.

### Happenings ✏️
</div>

![Allan Kaprow, _18 Happenings in 6 Parts_, 1959, via MoMA, New York](https://cdn.thecollector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/allan-kaprow-happenings-6-parts-1959.jpg?width=786&quality=100&dpr=2)

<!--
18 Happenings in 6 Parts took place in the New Yorker Reuben Gallery and lasted for approximately 90 minutes. As the name of the performance suggests, 18 Happenings in 6 Parts consists of six parts that each include three art happenings. The three happenings always took place simultaneously. The audience was instructed via programs that they should not applaud when the individual parts were completed, but they could applaud after the sixth part. The gallery was split into three rooms by plastic sheets with wooden frames that displayed references to some of Allan Kaprow’s previous works. Since the gallery was divided into rooms and the art happenings took place simultaneously, the audience was not able to see every single performance.

The happening Yard took place in the courtyard of the Martha Jackson Gallery. Allan Kaprow filled the space with old tires and wrapped the sculptures that were exhibited in the courtyard with black paper. The audience climbed over the tiles while Kaprow piled them. The use of old tires reminds us of Kaprow’s statement from his essay “The Legacy of Jackson Pollock”: “Objects of every sort are materials for the new art: paint, chairs, food, electric and neon lights, smoke, water, old socks, a dog, movies, a thousand other things which will be discovered by the present generation of artists.”

But how does a happening work according to Allan Kaprow? In his lecture “How to Make a Happening” Kaprow established 11 rules for art happenings:

“Forget all the standard art forms.”
“You can steer clear of art by mixing up your happening by mixing it with life situations.“
“The situations for a happening should come from what you see in the real world, from real places and people rather than from the head.“
“Break up your spaces. A single enactment space is what the theatre traditionally uses.”
“Break up your time and let it be real-time. Real-time is found when things are going on in real places.”
“Arrange all your events in the happening in the same practical way. Not in an arty way.“
“Since you’re in the world now and not in art, play the game by real rules. Make up your mind when and where a happening is appropriate.“
“Work with the power around you, not against it.”
“When you’ve got the go-ahead, don’t rehearse the happening. This will make it unnatural because it will build in the idea of good performance, that is, art.”
“Perform the happening once only. Repeating it makes it stale, reminds you of theatre, and does the same thing as rehearsing.“
“Give up the whole idea of putting on a show for audiences. A happening is not a show. Leave the shows to the theatre people and discotheques.“

Black Mountain College (1933–1957)
</div>

<!-- 

Black Mountain College was an experiment in progressive education that brought together creative minds from all over the globe to the rural Swannanoa Valley of Black Mountain, North Carolina. As a liberal arts school, the College was short-lived, opening in 1933 and closing by 1957 due to financial struggles and other structural challenges. 


Some of the worlds greatest modern artists, writers, performers, musicians, and even scientists served as students and faculty at Black Mountain College, including Josef & Anni Albers, Charles Olsen, Merce Cunningham, Robert Rauschenberg, Willem & Elaine de Kooning, Buckminster Fuller, M.C. Richards, and many others.

Rauschenberg arrived at Black Mountain College in the fall of 1953 as a student in the school's renowned summer art program. There, he studied under Josef Albers, who was known for his rigorous approach to color theory and geometric abstraction. Rauschenberg's time at Black Mountain College was transformative, as he was exposed to new ideas and techniques that would shape his artistic practice.

#### Combine painting ✏️
</div>


![Robert Rauschenberg, _Bed_, 1955](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1770050002/2026nwp-ar2205/W1siZiIsIjUyNzIzNSJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCItcXVhbGl0eSA5MCAtcmVzaXplIDIwMDB4MjAwMFx1MDAzZSJdXQ_t8m5qb.jpg)

<Asterisk />

<!--
series of Combines (1954–64)

In  Bed (1955), for example, he covered a large wall-mounted board with a pillow and patchwork quilt which he then marked with graphite scrawls and exuberant lashings of paint, the latter perhaps an ironic nod to Abstract Expressionism.

Bed is one of Robert Rauschenberg’s first combines, a term he coined to describe the works resulting from his technique of attaching found objects to a traditional canvas support. 
 
In this work, however, there is no canvas. The artist took a well-worn pillow, sheet, and quilt, scribbled on them with pencil, splashed them with paint in a style similar to Jackson Pollock’s action paintings, and hung the entire ensemble on the wall.

Rauschenberg used his own bedding (and a quilt from Dorothea Rockburne) to make Bed, because he could not afford to buy a new canvas. “It was very simply put together, because I actually had nothing to paint on,” he reflected years later. “Except it was summertime, it was hot, so I didn’t need the quilt. So the quilt was, I thought, abstracted. But it wasn’t abstracted enough, so that no matter what I did to it, it kept saying, ‘I’m a bed.’ So, finally I gave in and I gave it a pillow.”

Hung on the wall like a traditional painting, his bed becomes a sort of intimate self-portrait consistent with his assertion that “painting relates to both art and life…I try to act in that gap between the two.”

<!-- 

- Automobile Tire Print (1953) records one of Robert Rauschenberg’s most intriguing collaborative efforts. In 1953, the artist directed composer John Cage (1912–1992) to drive his Model A Ford in a straight line over twenty sheets of paper that Rauschenberg had glued together and laid in the road outside his Fulton Street studio in Lower Manhattan. The car’s front tire left a faint embossed impression, while the rear tire, which had passed through a pool of paint Rauschenberg had poured in the street, deposited a juicy black tread mark that stretches in a diminishing line along the twenty-two-foot length of paper. 
- Over the years, Automobile Tire Print has been interpreted as a monoprint, a drawing, a performance, a process piece, and a distinctive exploration of indexical mark making. In its serial imagery (it records nearly three revolutions of Cage’s wheel)

- Like Rauschenberg’s Erased de Kooning Drawing, which was also created in fall 1953, Automobile Tire Print challenges traditional understandings of art and authorship.

<Asterisk />

<!-- 

Canyon is one of Rauschenberg’s Combines, the hybrid works incorporating painting, collage, and found objects that he began making in 1954. Rauschenberg often kept an eye out for curious items while walking the streets in downtown Manhattan, later taking “whatever the day would lay out” and using it toward artistic ends.

In 1959 he received a phone call from a friend, the artist Sari Dienes, who offered him a taxidermy eagle she had found among objects destined for the trash. Back in his studio, Rauschenberg set to work incorporating the bird into a canvas along with other nontraditional materials—the cuff of a men’s shirtsleeve, an industrial metal canister, a photograph of his young son, a pillow—all collaged among fabric and printed matter and covered with various kinds of paint.

“A pair of socks,” Rauschenberg declared of his Combines, “is no less suitable to make a painting with than wood, nails, turpentine, oil, and fabric.” By incorporating the stuff of the everyday world into painting, Rauschenberg challenged the heroic gestural painting of the Abstract Expressionist artists who had preceded him and asserted an openness to ordinary objects that would be widespread among later generations of artists.

<!-- 

- In 1953, Rauschenberg created one of his most famous works, Erased de Kooning Drawing, by taking a drawing by Willem de Kooning and erasing it. 
- Rauschenberg sought and received de Kooning’s permission to erase one of his drawings, which he did over the course of a month, using a variety of erasers. The result is a nearly blank sheet of paper, bearing only faint traces of the original drawing. Rauschenberg mounted the erased drawing on a backing board and framed it, adding the title and his signature to the lower edge.
- The work challenges traditional notions of art and authorship, as it raises questions about the value of the erased drawing and the act of erasure itself as a creative process.

### Assemblage ✏️
</div>

<!--
Soap bubble sets were among Cornell’s earliest imaginary constructions, going back to his contribution to the 1936–37 exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art in New York. This box forms an interesting contrast with the other Soap Bubble Set in the Bergman collection (see Soap Bubble Set). Here the bold form of the moon fills the back panel, its pitted surface finding an echo in the cork ball suspended on the parallel rods. Like the earlier box, this one includes a drinking glass. A clay pipe lying on the floor of the box forges the link between the “bubbles” and the planets. Cornell seems to wish to counteract, however, the obviously poetic, dreamlike connotations of this box by emphasizing the scientific interest of the moon through its precisely “mapped” surface and the tables with astronomical data pasted in at the left and right.


### Assemblage
assamblage art form or medium usually created on a defined substrate that consists of three-dimensional elements projecting out of or from the substrate. It is similar to collage, a two-dimensional medium. Assemblage is part of the visual arts and is related to collage, sculpture, and montage.

<!-- 

It has been said that Jasper Johns’s Painted Bronze (1960) was generated by an offhand remark uttered in 1960 by the Abstract Expressionist, Willem de Kooning. The Dutchman was apparently grousing about Johns’s suave dealer, Leo Castelli, and his ability to market works by emerging artists. “Give that son-of-a-bitch two beer cans,” de Kooning supposedly snarled, “and he could sell them.”

Painted Bronze initially seems banal—two 12-ounce beer cans standing on a simple rectangular base. But for Johns, the gay South Carolina-transplant to New York, these faux-liquid containers were rooted in rich personal and aesthetic histories brimming with meaning.

<!-- 

Johns's Target with Four Faces (1955) combines familiar imagery with a tactile surface and sculptural elements. The target motif, a recurring theme in Johns's work, is presented here with a unique twist.

he was a partner of Robert Rauschenberg but had a very different approach to art-making. While Rauschenberg embraced chance and spontaneity, Johns was more methodical and deliberate in his process. They later collaborated on several projects, including the creation of the "White Paintings" series.

For Johns the common shooting target is one of the many "things the mind already knows." Using familiar objects "gives me room to work on other levels," he has explained. Though the target is closely linked with the acts of looking and aiming, the concentric circles of Johns's version are obscured and the surface made tactile with encaustic—pigment mixed with beeswax—on collage. Mounted above the target, four plaster casts taken from a single model over a period of several months are arranged in nonsequential order. A hinged wooden lid offers the option of shutting away the small niches that hold these cropped, eyeless faces.

<!--
“It all began . . . with my painting a picture of an American flag,” Johns remarked in 1959, in reference to this work. The artist made Flag using a cut bedsheet, oil paint, and encaustic (pigment mixed with melted wax). He dipped strips of cloth and newsprint into the hot wax, then affixed them to the sheet to fill in a penciled outline of the US flag. The result is a picture whose process is registered on its surface. Johns went on to use encaustic to depict common forms—flags, targets, numbers, letters, and maps—time and again throughout his career.

Many of Conner’s “BLACK WAX SCULPTURES,” made between 1959 and 1963, repeat the same motif—a half-mummified body bound to a supporting structure—and they evoke spiritual issues surrounding death and the afterlife while simultaneously pointing to more concrete political concerns having to do with capital punishment, abortion, nuclear Armageddon, and war. CHILD (1959) depicts a grimacing figure composed of wax, cloth, and metal, lashed to a scavenged wooden high chair; it was created to protest the impending execution of Caryl Chessman, sent to the gas chamber in 1960 for heinous, but non-murderous, crimes. Superimposing the nurturing of an infant with the execution of a man, Conner’s assemblage blends political activism with an evocation of moral crisis. There is a palpable sense of spiritual loss here, an atmosphere that suggests that U.S. society was becoming increasingly bloodthirsty and that traditional religious belief systems no longer held sway.

California-born artist Betye Saar, for instance, interrogated American history and Black identity by using artifacts portraying racist caricatures, in everything from figurines to food packaging. In Saar’s groundbreaking assemblage The Liberation of Aunt Jemima, found objects relaying harmful racial stereotypes are empowered through explicit reference to the era’s liberation politics. As she explains, “I was recycling the imagery, in a way, from negative to positive.”

Daniel Spoerri (German pronunciation: [SHPUR-ee; 27 March 1930 – 6 November 2024) was a Romanian-born Swiss visual artist and writer. He is considered to be an important figure among the artists within the so-called "second wave" of the Pop art movement.

Spoerri is best known for his "snare-pictures," a type of assemblage or object art, in which he captured a group of objects, such as the remains of meals eaten by individuals, including the plates, silverware, and glasses, all of which are fixed to the table or board, which is then displayed on a wall. He also is widely acclaimed for his book, Topographie Anécdotée* du Hasard (An Anecdoted Topography of Chance), a literary analog to his snare-pictures, in which he mapped all the objects located on his table at a particular moment, describing each with his personal recollections evoked by the object.

Kelin born in 1928 in Nice, France. He was a jazz musician and a judo expert before turning to art in the late 1940s.

he used a flame-thrower

the action labelled Cosnogonie (Cosmogony) involved the use of a flame-thrower to create large-scale works on canvas. By directing the intense heat of the flame-thrower onto the surface of the canvas, Klein was able to create dynamic and unpredictable patterns of color and texture. The resulting works were characterized by their boldness and energy, as well as their sense of spontaneity and improvisation.

## about event
On November 27, 1960, the French artist Yves Klein distributed a newspaper bearing the masthead Le Journal d’un Seul Jour—“The Newspaper of a Single Day”—whose cover page featured an unusual and shocking photograph: the artist is pictured mid-air, leaping off the roof of a suburban home, with his body outstretched in a calm and balletic pose. Klein’s serene expression is countered by the viewer’s own terror upon realizing that he will soon succumb to gravity and fall to the cobblestone street. The page contains a bold headline that announces the Théâtre du Vide—“the theatre of life.” 

-   Klein’s leap is a metaphor for his artistic practice, which sought to transcend the material world and reach a higher spiritual plane. The artist’s “leap into the void” is a symbolic act of faith, representing his belief in the power of art to elevate the human spirit beyond the limitations of the physical world.

<!-- 

When one collector expressed interest in purchasing an “invisible” painting from his empty gallery, Klein had an idea. What if he created specific terms for buying a non-existent work? 

Starting in 1959, he sold a few works that disappeared during staged rituals. He wasn’t selling a material piece of art but a space, grandiloquently called the “Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility.” To obtain it, one had to pay a fair amount of gold. Klein would then sign a cheque. However, to complete the work, the buyer had to burn the cheque over the Seine River, with Klein and witnesses present. As the cheque’s ashes blew in the wind, Klein dropped half of the gold, in the form of gold leaf, into the river. The remaining gold flickered in the air before sinking into the water, symbolizing the ephemeral nature of his art.

... an example of an artist who was important for what he did---the symbolic value of his actions---rather than for what he made. One sees in him an example of the increasing tendency for the personality of the artist to be his or her own true and complete creation.
