Yet it is surely significant that they are inward-turned without being truly introspective. They look, not at the world outside, nor at the psyche, but at the familiar paraphernalia of the artist's workshop. Their greatness comes, not from new inventions, but from refinement of invention.

<!-- 

in the 1940s Matisse's health began to decline, and by 1950 he was largely confined to a wheelchair. Yet his creative energy remained undiminished.

In the final decades of his life, Matisse invented a new form of art, the cut-out. Working with scissors and sheets of gouache-painted paper, he cut various shapes—from the organic to the geometric—and  arranged them into lively compositions. Cut-outs formed the prototypes for the printed images in the illustrated book Jazz, which Matisse insisted remain absolutely faithful to the original colors. In response, the publisher turned to pochoir, a stencil printing technique in which the same gouaches could be used. Matisse created two versions of the prints: one for a portfolio and the second for the illustrated book, whose plates were interspersed with a text by Matisse, written in his looping calligraphy.

- papier decoupe (cut paper)
  - Matisse would paint sheets of paper with gouache, then cut shapes from them with scissors. These shapes were then arranged into compositions and pasted onto a backing paper.
  - the method encouraged extrene simplification, and helped to discipline Matisse's decorative gift.
