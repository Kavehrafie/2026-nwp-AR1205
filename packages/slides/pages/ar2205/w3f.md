<!--
in the 1940s Matisse's health began to decline, and by 1950 he was largely confined to a wheelchair. Yet his creative energy remained undiminished.

In the final decades of his life, Matisse invented a new form of art, the cut-out. Working with scissors and sheets of gouache-painted paper, he cut various shapes—from the organic to the geometric—and  arranged them into lively compositions. Cut-outs formed the prototypes for the printed images in the illustrated book Jazz, which Matisse insisted remain absolutely faithful to the original colors. In response, the publisher turned to pochoir, a stencil printing technique in which the same gouaches could be used. Matisse created two versions of the prints: one for a portfolio and the second for the illustrated book, whose plates were interspersed with a text by Matisse, written in his looping calligraphy.

Snail in the picture

In the late 1940s, Henri Matisse turned almost exclusively to cut paper as his primary medium, and scissors as his chief implement, introducing a radically new operation that came to be called a cut-out. Matisse would cut painted sheets into forms of varying shapes and sizes—from the vegetal to the abstract—which he then arranged into lively compositions, striking for their play with color and contrast, their exploitation of decorative strategies, and their economy of means. Initially, these compositions were of modest size but, over time, their scale grew along with Matisse’s ambitions for them, expanding into mural or room-size works

<!-- 

The fervent nature of Guttusos politics is captured in The Discussion. The work mixes the reportage style of Socialist Realism with the modernist device of collage, and shows a scene of heated debate. Partial headlines are legible, such as 'Proletariat' and 'Today in Moscow'. It coincided with Guttuso's increasing need to defend art that was committed to realism at a time when many in the Western European Communist parties were questioning its value following the death of Stalin and the disintegration of Stalinism.

<!-- 


Balthus a blend of surrealism and classicism. Inspired by Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Piero della Francesca, Caravaggio, and Vermeer, Balthus's work is characterized by its meticulous technique, enigmatic subjects, and a dreamlike atmosphere.

The artwork features a surreal and dreamlike scene set by the seaside. Central to the composition is an anthropomorphic cat, depicted in a human posture, sitting at a table arranged with dining utensils and a meal, complete with a fish and a glass of wine. The cat wears a bib and holds a knife and fork, exuding an air of sophistication and peculiarity. To the left, a woman is depicted rowing a small boat, appearing calm amidst the surrounding waters. 

In “Lady Abdy,” the viewer is presented with the image of a woman, seemingly lost in a moment of contemplation or curiosity, as she peers through a window. Her somber, introspective expression and the soft light filtering through the sheer curtain against the darker, more defined interior create a striking contrast that draws attention to both her figure and her emotional state. Her red dress, flowing and voluminous, adds a dramatic element to the composition, further enhanced by the subdued, earthy tones that characterize the room. The interplay between light and shadow, coupled with the careful rendering of textures and forms, exemplifies Balthus’s skill in evoking a sense of quiet mystery and nuanced emotion within a seemingly ordinary domestic scene.

- suggestive and enigmatic quality
- the tension between innocence and experience, vulnerability and strength, which is a recurring theme in Balthus's work.
- erotic undertones with malice cloaked in innocence
- often nude, adolescent girls in private, intimate settings, inviting sexual violence
  
- **Disturbing Power Dynamics**: Balthus's work is deeply controversial for its repeated depiction of young girls in sexually suggestive poses, often placed in voyeuristic or vulnerable contexts. The tension between innocence and experience is manipulated to create an unsettling eroticism that many viewers find exploitative.

- **Problematic Gaze**: The paintings often position the viewer as a voyeur, complicit in a gaze that sexualizes underage subjects. This dynamic raises serious ethical questions about the artist's intent and the work's reception, particularly in light of ongoing cultural conversations about the representation of minors in art.

Can add the controversy about the representation of minors in media and art given the recent grok ai scandals

#### ART INFORMEL ✏️
</div>

<!-- 

### Art Informel
Art Informel (French: "formless art") is a term coined in the mid-20th century to describe a range of abstract art movements that emerged in Europe after World War II. It is characterized by an emphasis on spontaneity, improvisation, and the physical act of painting, often rejecting traditional forms and structures.
- influeced for the decade to come before the influx of American Abstract Expressionism in Europe

### Jean Fautrier

Fautrier’s coarse, coagulated surfaces evoked the raw textures of everyday life. In his ordered studio in the suburbs of Paris, the artist created turmoil in haute pâte (high paste).

Today this style is known as Art Informel, the product of a movement that emerged in France out of the chaos and destruction of the Second World War. Its proponents were a group of battle-worn individuals who had experienced human suffering and bore the responsibility of survival.
- contraditory position the Lucie-Smith describes for them (Jean Fautrier, Maurice Estève, Edouard Pignon, Jean Bazaine): 
  - the impetud of modernist revolution
  - maintaining the prestige of Paris (and collectors and dealers apparatus) in the postwar art world

‘Otages’ (‘Hostages’), is a series made between 1943 and 1945, when the artist was staying at the Maison de Santé in the Vallée-aux-Loups, a psychiatric ward in the Paris suburbs. Fautrier had retreated there after being arrested and held for four days as a suspected member of the Resistance in January 1943. From his room he could hear prisoners being executed by the Gestapo in the nearby forest, and it was the anguish he felt, according to the art historian Sarah Wilson, that provided the impetus for the paintings.

Tête d’Otage, from 1944, is a distorted image of a head the colour of bruised flesh. In the 1945 work Otage (above), splashes of red and yellow paint suggest lesions and wounds. The art critic Pierre Restany described these paintings as expressions of ‘anger, fear, hatred, impotence, tenderness and human solidarity’.

- Fautrier was one of the leading figures of Art Informel, a post-war European art movement that emphasized spontaneity, texture, and the physicality of materials. His work often explored themes of human suffering and existential angst, reflecting the trauma of World War II.
- matter painting: Fautrier's technique involved the use of thick impasto, layering materials such as plaster, sand, and other substances onto the canvas to create a highly textured surface. This approach allowed him to convey a sense of physicality and depth, making the viewer acutely aware of the materiality of the artwork itself.

- acclecticism of the postwar European art scene
- "Fauvism, Cubism and Expressionism jostled together to make an amalgam that had litle that  was new in it." (Lucie-Smith, 54) 

#### Edouard Pignon
Pignon's father was a miner and he himself had worked down the pits as a young man in the Pas-de-Calais, France. In 1949-50 he made a series of paintings about the official suppression of strikes and demands for better working conditions. Although a Communist Party member, Pignon departed somewhat from the official Socialist Realist style. In his depiction of the man rolling a cigarette, for example, he employs a simplification that is indebted to Picasso

#### Maurice Estève

... it is possible to feel nearly all the European free abstractionists of the late 1940s and the early 1950s suffer from a thinness of emotion and a restriction of technical means. At the same time, one must sympathize with their predicament. .... The European experiments were ... less sure of their direction than those being made in New York.

<!-- 
Wols (1913–51) was a German-born artist (full name: Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze) who settled in Paris in 1934. He is considered one of the pioneers of Art Informel and is known for his abstract paintings and drawings that often feature spontaneous, gestural marks and a sense of improvisation.

<!-- 

- Wols was important post war European artist who bridged Surrealism and Art Informel. He was inspired by Paul Klee and his biomorphic abstractions. 

  - Klee's influence is evident in Wols's use of organic shapes, fluid lines, and a sense of spontaneity in his compositions. Both artists shared an interest in exploring the subconscious and the irrational through their art.

  - Wols's work often features a similar sense of playfulness and experimentation with form and color that can be seen in Klee's paintings. However, Wols's approach is generally more gestural and dynamic, reflecting the post-war context in which he was working.

  - While Klee's work is often characterized by a more structured and deliberate composition, Wols embraced a more spontaneous and improvisational style, which became a hallmark of Art Informel.

#### Matter Painting ✏️
</div>

<!-- 

- Matter Painting is a style of abstract art that emerged in Europe in the mid-20th century, particularly in the 1940s and 1950s. It is characterized by the use of unconventional materials and textures to create a tactile, three-dimensional surface on the canvas. Artists associated with Matter Painting often incorporated materials such as sand, plaster, fabric, and found objects into their works, emphasizing the physicality of the artwork itself. 
- We saw in Fautrier's work the use of thick impasto and mixed media to create textured surfaces that evoke emotional depth and existential themes.

- Tàpies's work often features a muted color palette, with earthy tones and subdued hues
- he was liberal (from Barcelona) but his works ambiguous enoguh to be embraced by the Franco regime in Spain
- It `hand-made` texture writes Luci-Smith, tended to align itself with the products of the Spanish luxury crafts
- their work became associated with a kind of nationalist pride in traditional Spanish culture.

<!-- 

Burri was imprisoned during World War II as an Italian soldier and began creating art while in a U.S. prisoner-of-war camp. His early works were made from burlap sacks, which he stitched and burned to create textured surfaces. This use of unconventional materials became a hallmark of his style.

he claimed that his art was not political, but the raw, distressed materials he used often evoked themes of suffering, destruction, and regeneration, resonating with the post-war context in which he worked.

his reason for using these materials was the they reminded him of the blood-soaked bandages used to treat wounded soldiers during the war. 

he has also made use of charred wood, of plastic foil burned and melted with a blow-lamp and battered plates of tin

the influence of American Abstract Expressionism on postwar European art
- the European artists were less sure of their direction than those being made in New York (Lucie-Smith, 64)
- Peggy Guggenheim's collection in Venice helped introduce European audiences to the new American art 1948
- the influx of American art into Europe in the late 1940s and 1950s had a significant impact on the European art scene, influencing both artists and movements across the continent.

Pierre Soulages, for example, was deeply influenced by the gestural techniques of Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline. Soulages's use of black paint and his exploration of texture and light in his "Outrenoir" series can be seen as a response to the dynamic, expressive qualities of American Abstract Expressionism.

### CobrA Movement
The CoBrA movement was an avant-garde art movement that emerged in Europe in the late 1940s, specifically between 1948 and 1951. The name "CoBrA" is derived from the initials of the cities where the founding members were based: Copenhagen (Co), Brussels (Br), and Amsterdam (A). The movement was characterized by its emphasis on spontaneity, experimentation, and a rejection of traditional artistic conventions. Subject matter often included fantastical creatures, landscapes, and figures rendered in a childlike, expressive style.

- continued the old European tradition of expressive, semi-figurative painting. Greater complexity of refeencess than other European movements of the time

- the names associated with the movement include Asger Jorn (Denmark), Karel Appel (Netherlands), Constant Nieuwenhuys (Netherlands), Corneille (Belgium), and Pierre Alechinsky (Belgium).

- his first solo show in 1945 a few month after the liberation of Paris
- interested in the art of children and persons with a mental health condition, oputside art which he saw as more authentic and untainted by cultural conventions.
- grafdfiti on walls or pavements

- his Art Brut (Raw Art) movement, which celebrated the creativity of outsiders and non-professional artists, such as children and psychiatric patients.

- he was like Eugene Ionesco (Romanian-French playwright) in theater: both rejected traditional forms and embraced absurdity and spontaneity to challenge established norms in their respective fields.

- grossness and crudity in texture and subject matter

... Dubuffet seems to me to sum up many of the leading tendencies to be found in the visual arts in the period immediately following the war. The priority given to the inner world of the artist, and the rejection of the traditional claims of art to be more coherent, more organized, and more homogeneous than `non-art`, or `reality`, were pointers to the future.
