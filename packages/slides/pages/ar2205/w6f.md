<!-- 
- In the mid-1960s, American artist Robert Morris created a series of works that were made of earth and other natural materials. One of these was a large mound of dirt that he built in the Green Gallery in New York.
- In 1970, Morris created a much larger earthwork called "Spiral Jetty" in the Great Salt Lake in Utah. This work consists of a long, spiraling jetty made of rocks and earth that extends into the lake.

### Land Art ✏️
</div>

<!--
Argentine artist Nicolás García Uriburu dyed the Grand Canal of Venice with a vibrant green pigment in 1968. Two years later, American artist Robert Smithson moved some six thousand tons of black basalt rocks into the form of a spiraling coil that juts out from the shore into the waters of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 

Both of these works exemplify the radical genre of Land Art—art made in or of the natural environment—which was one among the eclectic array of new artistic  practices that emerged in the mid-to-late twentieth century.

### land art
- Land Art, also known as Earth Art or Earthworks, is an art movement that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. It involves creating large-scale artworks using natural materials such as soil, rocks, and vegetation, often in remote outdoor locations. Land Art challenges traditional notions of art by integrating it with the landscape and emphasizing the relationship between humans and nature. Notable artists associated with Land Art include Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt, and Walter De Maria.
