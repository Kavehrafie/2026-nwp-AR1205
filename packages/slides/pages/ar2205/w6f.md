<!-- 
- In the mid-1960s, American artist Robert Morris created a series of works that were made of earth and other natural materials. One of these was a large mound of dirt that he built in the Green Gallery in New York.
- In 1970, Morris created a much larger earthwork called "Spiral Jetty" in the Great Salt Lake in Utah. This work consists of a long, spiraling jetty made of rocks and earth that extends into the lake.

### Land Art ✏️
</div>

<!--
Argentine artist Nicolás García Uriburu dyed the Grand Canal of Venice with a vibrant green pigment in 1968. Two years later, American artist Robert Smithson moved some six thousand tons of black basalt rocks into the form of a spiraling coil that juts out from the shore into the waters of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 

Both of these works exemplify the radical genre of Land Art—art made in or of the natural environment—which was one among the eclectic array of new artistic  practices that emerged in the mid-to-late twentieth century.

### land art
- Land Art, also known as Earth Art or Earthworks, is an art movement that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. It involves creating large-scale artworks using natural materials such as soil, rocks, and vegetation, often in remote outdoor locations. Land Art challenges traditional notions of art by integrating it with the landscape and emphasizing the relationship between humans and nature. Notable artists associated with Land Art include Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt, and Walter De Maria.

"For my film (a film is a spiral made of frames) I would have myself filmed from a helicopter (from  the Greek _helix_, _helikos_ meaning spiral) directly overhead in order to get the scale in terms of erratic steps."

<!-- 

- Morris helped to define the principles of Minimalism with his art and writings, but by the late 1960s he had tempered its often severe, geometrical appearance with softer, organic materials, thus becoming a founder of what is known as Post–Minimalism, too. Felt, copper tubing, asphalt, steel cable, lead, and double-sided mirrors punctuate this amorphous mass of thread waste, remnants from textile manufacturing. Morris deliberately relinquished much of his artistic control to the materials themselves, writing, "Chance is accepted and indeterminacy is implied."
- exhibited at Castle Gallery, London, 1968, and the following year at the Green Gallery, New York.
- Proceeding from ideas Morris had articulated the previous spring in “Anti Form” (from which Leider quoted), this emphasis on the artist’s direct physical manipulation of pliable materials frequently resulted in a residue of randomly dispersed matter.

![Robert Smithson, _Double Nonsite_, California and Nevada, 1968--69](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1771843490/2026nwp-ar2205/2019_NYR_16977_0031B_000_robert_smithson_double_nonsite_california_and_nevada103119_uv7wxr.jpg)


<!-- 

Distinguished by its restrained aesthetic and fascinating geological components, Robert Smithson’s Double Nonsite, California and Nevada is a quintessential example of the artist’s pioneering series of Nonsites of 1968-1969. Stemming from rock-hunting excursions that Smithson took with artists Michael Heizer and Nancy Holt during the summer of 1968, the present work demonstrates the key attributes of this important series, in which rugged raw materials from geologically diverse areas (“sites”) are transported into the pristine arena of the gallery space (the “nonsite”). Arranged in Minimalist configurations, Smithson allows the interplay between the rough-hewn texture of the rocks and the sleek geometry of their containers to play out before the viewer’s eye. In the present work—which is possibly the only “double” Nonsite the artist ever created, with material coming from not one, but two “sites”—Smithson places shiny pieces of black obsidian foraged from Mineral County, Nevada near pumice-like cinders from the Marl Mountains of California’s Mojave Desert. Arranged in white steel boxes around a central square, Smithson mimics the formation of an active volcano in order to symbolically indicate the prehistoric origins of both materials (the black obsidian results from cooled lava near the volcano’s epicenter while the cinders are usually formed around its periphery). Typically, Smithson also includes a map of the geographical location from which the rocks are derived. In this case, he includes two maps that have been superimposed and rendered in photographic negative, one from each location in California and Nevada. As one of the most significant Nonsites Smithson created in 1968, Double Nonsite, California and Nevada has featured in many exhibitions, articles and books of the artist’s work.

- in the Nonsites, Smithson demonstrates how these geological processes are contained both physically and conceptually by the cultural disciplines of engineering, sceience, and mechanical reproduction.

<!-- 

- Walter De Maria’s The Lightning Field (1977) is a long-term installation located in western New Mexico. The work consists of 400 stainless steel poles arranged in a grid pattern over an area of one mile by one kilometer. The poles are designed to attract lightning strikes, creating a dramatic visual display during thunderstorms. The Lightning Field is considered a significant example of Land Art, as it integrates natural elements with human-made structures to create a unique and immersive experience for viewers.
- The work is intended to be experienced over time, as visitors can stay overnight in a nearby cabin to witness the changing light and weather conditions that affect the appearance of the poles. The Lightning Field challenges traditional notions of art by emphasizing the relationship between humans and nature, and it has become an iconic example of Land Art in the United States.
