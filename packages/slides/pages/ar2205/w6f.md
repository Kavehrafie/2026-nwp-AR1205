<!-- 
- In the mid-1960s, American artist Robert Morris created a series of works that were made of earth and other natural materials. One of these was a large mound of dirt that he built in the Green Gallery in New York.
- In 1970, Morris created a much larger earthwork called "Spiral Jetty" in the Great Salt Lake in Utah. This work consists of a long, spiraling jetty made of rocks and earth that extends into the lake.

### Land Art ✏️
</div>

<!--
Argentine artist Nicolás García Uriburu dyed the Grand Canal of Venice with a vibrant green pigment in 1968. Two years later, American artist Robert Smithson moved some six thousand tons of black basalt rocks into the form of a spiraling coil that juts out from the shore into the waters of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 

Both of these works exemplify the radical genre of Land Art—art made in or of the natural environment—which was one among the eclectic array of new artistic  practices that emerged in the mid-to-late twentieth century.

### land art
- Land Art, also known as Earth Art or Earthworks, is an art movement that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. It involves creating large-scale artworks using natural materials such as soil, rocks, and vegetation, often in remote outdoor locations. Land Art challenges traditional notions of art by integrating it with the landscape and emphasizing the relationship between humans and nature. Notable artists associated with Land Art include Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt, and Walter De Maria.

<!-- 

- In 1967, Claes Oldenburg created the Placid Civic Monument in Central Park, New York. 
- The very fact that on Sunday, October 1, 1967, an excavation as a work of art was produced by Claes Oldenburg, one who cannot be considered an earthworker but who was an innovator in the realms of Happenings and Pop Art, suggests the status in the art world at that time of working with geological material. Exactly a year later, at the Dwan Gallery in New York City, documentation of this work and also other sculpture by Oldenburg would go on view among documentation and sculpture by nine other artists in the exhibition zaARTH woRrkKS, the debut ofthe genre. Dug a year before that show brought the movement to widespread public attention, Oldenburg’s temporary trench epitomizes the multiple sources of Earthworks and the relation of these works to the “dirt” around them. Characteristic of Oldenburg’s manner ofdialectical play, the Hole’s six-foot-long rectangular recession encompasses associations ranging from the formal to the funereal.

- Oldenburg’s Hole, which was dug in Central Park, was a work of art that was created by excavating a rectangular hole in the ground. The hole was six feet long and three feet wide, and it was dug to a depth of six feet. The work was intended to be a commentary on the relationship between art and nature, and it was meant to challenge traditional notions of what art could be. The Hole was a temporary installation, and it was filled back in after a few days.

Art historian Suzaan Boettger was the first to posit the heterotopia as an art historical model, arguing that early earthworks were ‘counter- or anti-monuments’ and that land artist Robert Smithson’s photo-journalistic snapshots of New Jersey (1967–8) and Claus Oldenburg’s ironic Placid Civic Monument 1967 in New York’s Central Park were ‘fundamentally mixed’ counter-sites that amounted to ‘inversions of art in public places’.

### Site-specificity ✏️
</div>

<!--
This formative piece was made on one of Long’s journeys to St Martin’s from his home in Bristol. Between hitchhiking lifts, he stopped in a field in Wiltshire where he walked backwards and forwards until the flattened turf caught the sunlight and became visible as a line. He photographed this work, and recorded his physical interventions within the landscape.
Although this artwork underplays the artist’s corporeal presence, it anticipates a widespread interest in performative art practice. This piece demonstrates how Long had already found a visual language for his lifelong concerns with impermanence, motion and relativity.
- ephemeral
- site-specific: works that are created in response to a specific location and are often designed to interact with the natural environment. These works are typically not meant to be moved or displayed in a traditional gallery setting, and they often challenge traditional notions of art by emphasizing the relationship between the artwork and its surroundings. Site-specific art can take many forms, including sculptures, installations, and land art, and it often encourages viewers to engage with the environment in new and meaningful ways.

«A flying leap downthe years (and up 57th Street) brings us from maximal to minimal. The Dwan Gallery, headquarters for a group of modular, «systemie» artists, will spring an earthier show than usual this October – in fact, Mother Earth is both the medium and message. The participants -Walter de Maria, Claes Oldenburg, Mike Heizer, Robert Smithson, Sol Lewitt, Robert Morris and Dennis Oppenheim – have hatched concepts for (earthworks: projects for prospective outdoor sites […]

The show will conceivably help demonstrate the emergence of artists as thinkers. «We’re getting away from the object-oriented thing,» Smithson declares. «It’s diametrically opposed to the whole idea of rationalistic painting and sculpture. What it will lead to is that objects won’t be so sought after.


### EARTH WORKS, 1968, Dwan Gallery, NY

- In 1968, Robert Morris created a series of works called "Earthworks," which were large-scale installations made of natural materials such as soil, rocks, and vegetation. These works were meant to be experienced in outdoor settings, and they often involved the manipulation of the landscape to create new forms and shapes. The Earthworks were intended to challenge traditional notions of art and to explore the relationship between humans and nature, and they are considered a significant example of Land Art.

<!-- 

- Virginia Dwan was a prominent art dealer and collector who played a significant role in the development of contemporary art in the 1960s and 1970s. She was known for her support of avant-garde artists and her willingness to take risks on new and experimental works. Dwan's gallery, the Dwan Gallery, was a hub for artists working in a variety of mediums, including painting, sculpture, and land art. She was instrumental in promoting the work of artists such as Robert Smithson, Walter De Maria, and Claes Oldenburg, among others. Dwan's contributions to the art world helped to shape the course of contemporary art and continue to be celebrated today.
- Dawn was coming from a wealthy family (the Dwan family made their fortune in the oil industry) and used her resources to support emerging artists and push the boundaries of contemporary art. Her gallery was known for showcasing innovative and experimental works, and she was instrumental in promoting the careers of many artists who are now considered major figures in the art world. Dwan's legacy as a patron of the arts continues to be celebrated today, and her contributions to the development of contemporary art are widely recognized.

<!-- 

- Morris helped to define the principles of Minimalism with his art and writings, but by the late 1960s he had tempered its often severe, geometrical appearance with softer, organic materials, thus becoming a founder of what is known as Post–Minimalism, too. Felt, copper tubing, asphalt, steel cable, lead, and double-sided mirrors punctuate this amorphous mass of thread waste, remnants from textile manufacturing. Morris deliberately relinquished much of his artistic control to the materials themselves, writing, "Chance is accepted and indeterminacy is implied."
- exhibited at Castle Gallery, London, 1968, and the following year at the Green Gallery, New York.
- Proceeding from ideas Morris had articulated the previous spring in “Anti Form” (from which Leider quoted), this emphasis on the artist’s direct physical manipulation of pliable materials frequently resulted in a residue of randomly dispersed matter.

<!-- 

During the 1960s, a number of artists-including Oppenheim, Robert Smithson, and Walter De Maria-sought to liberate sculpture from the pedestals of the museum and made work that was inextricably bound to its site. In this piece, Oppenheim enlarged the patterns of the tree's growth and, by shoveling pathways in the snow, transposed the annual rings to the frozen waterway that divides the United States and Canada and also divides their time zones. By juxtaposing man-made national and temporal boundaries, Oppenheim opened to question the relative values of the ordering systems by which we live.   

- Oppenheim’s Annual Rings (1968) is a land art piece that consists of a series of concentric circles carved into the snow on the frozen St. Lawrence River, which serves as the border between the United States and Canada. The circles were created by shoveling snow to reveal the ice beneath, and they represent the annual growth rings of a tree. The work is meant to explore themes of time, nature, and human intervention in the environment, and it challenges traditional notions of sculpture by using the natural landscape as its medium.

<!-- 

- In 1968, Robert Smithson created a series of works called "Nonsites," which were indoor earthworks that consisted of sand and other natural materials arranged in geometric shapes. These works were meant to be viewed in a gallery setting, but they were also accompanied by maps and photographs that documented the original location where the materials were sourced. The Nonsites were intended to challenge traditional notions of art and to explore the relationship between the artwork and its environment.

- in the Nonsites, Smithson demonstrates how these geological processes are contained both physically and conceptually by the cultural disciplines of engineering, sceience, and mechanical reproduction.

- The sculptural element of this first nonsite consists of a horizontally oriented, floorbound hexagonal panel sixty-five and a half:inches in diameter. On each of its six triangular wedges, five rows of trapezoidal aluminum bins, painted blue, descend in height from twelve inches at the circumference toward a small hexagonal bin in the center. Smithson took the concentric, six-pronged shape from the pattern of runways of the little-used wilderness airfield that he had seen during an April 1967 excursion to the Pine Barrens. Each bin contained sand from there, the dry, grainy groundcover endemic to lower New Jersey that gives the Barrens their name. Visually, the looseness of the beige sand presented a radically different materiality from that of the rigid blue steel boxes that contained it. His previous boxy steel sculptures composed in planes spilling into arcs—as if tenuous balance caught in a momentary stasis—also in that show, displayed the precedents to the sand piles’ potential amorphous spread.

<!-- 

Distinguished by its restrained aesthetic and fascinating geological components, Robert Smithson’s Double Nonsite, California and Nevada is a quintessential example of the artist’s pioneering series of Nonsites of 1968-1969. Stemming from rock-hunting excursions that Smithson took with artists Michael Heizer and Nancy Holt during the summer of 1968, the present work demonstrates the key attributes of this important series, in which rugged raw materials from geologically diverse areas (“sites”) are transported into the pristine arena of the gallery space (the “nonsite”). Arranged in Minimalist configurations, Smithson allows the interplay between the rough-hewn texture of the rocks and the sleek geometry of their containers to play out before the viewer’s eye. In the present work—which is possibly the only “double” Nonsite the artist ever created, with material coming from not one, but two “sites”—Smithson places shiny pieces of black obsidian foraged from Mineral County, Nevada near pumice-like cinders from the Marl Mountains of California’s Mojave Desert. Arranged in white steel boxes around a central square, Smithson mimics the formation of an active volcano in order to symbolically indicate the prehistoric origins of both materials (the black obsidian results from cooled lava near the volcano’s epicenter while the cinders are usually formed around its periphery). Typically, Smithson also includes a map of the geographical location from which the rocks are derived. In this case, he includes two maps that have been superimposed and rendered in photographic negative, one from each location in California and Nevada. As one of the most significant Nonsites Smithson created in 1968, Double Nonsite, California and Nevada has featured in many exhibitions, articles and books of the artist’s work.

<!-- 
- Double Negative is a defining work of Heizer’s career. Located in the Moapa Valley on Mormon Mesa near Overton, Nevada, the work consists of two massive straight trenches measuring thirty feet wide and fifty feet deep, formed through the displacement of 240,000 tons of desert sandstone. The two indentations imply a continuous linear volume—a negative sculpture slicing through and extending across the Mesa’s scalloped edge. The sixty-acre site for Double Negative was originally purchased by art collector and gallerist Virginia Dwan (1931–2022), who owned the sculpture until 1984 when she donated it to the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to coincide with the exhibition Michael Heizer: 45m, 90m, 180m/Geometric Extraction.

<!-- 
- Michael Heizer's City is a monumental earthwork located in the Nevada desert. The project began in 1972 and has been under construction for several decades. City is designed to be a massive, complex structure that incorporates various geometric forms and architectural elements, creating a futuristic cityscape. The work is intended to be experienced on foot, allowing visitors to explore its intricate pathways, tunnels, and open spaces. City is considered one of the most ambitious and significant examples of Land Art, showcasing Heizer's dedication to creating large-scale works that interact with the natural environment.
- massive scale: City is planned to cover an area of approximately one mile by one mile, making it one of the largest sculptures in the world. The sheer size of the work emphasizes the relationship between humans and the vastness of the natural landscape, and it challenges traditional notions of art by creating an immersive environment that encourages exploration and contemplation.
- Heizer's father, Robert Fleming Heizer (July 13, 1915 – July 18, 1979) was an archaeologist who conducted extensive fieldwork and reporting in California, the Southwestern United States, and the Great Basin.

Nancy Holt is known for artworks that engage the celestial: stars, sunlight, and orbiting bodies. In 2018, with support from the Holt/Smithson Foundation, Dia acquired Holt’s “Sun Tunnels” (1973–76) and continues to steward the work to this day.

Composed of four concrete cylinders—18 feet in length and 9 feet in diameter—“Sun Tunnels” is located in the Great Basin Desert in northwestern Utah. The work centers Holt’s interest in perception and time, sculpting the sun’s light through the interplay of land and sky and shifts from day to night.

- Holt’s “Sun Tunnels” is a land art installation located in the Great Basin Desert in Utah. The work consists of four large concrete tunnels arranged in an X shape, with each tunnel measuring 18 feet in length and 9 feet in diameter. The tunnels are positioned to align with the sunrise and sunset during the summer and winter solstices, creating a unique experience for viewers as they observe the changing light and shadows throughout the day. "Sun Tunnels" is considered a significant example of Land Art, as it integrates natural elements with human-made structures to create a harmonious relationship between art and the environment.
- The work is intended to be experienced over time, as visitors can stay overnight in a nearby cabin to witness the changing light and weather conditions that affect the appearance of the tunnels. "Sun Tunnels" challenges traditional notions of art by emphasizing the relationship between humans and nature, and it has become an iconic example of Land Art in the United States.

The Lightning Field challenges traditional notions of art by emphasizing the relationship between humans and nature, and it has become an iconic example of Land Art in the United States.
- - This work consists of 400 poles that are each set 220 feet apart in a grid format. The height of the piece varies from 15 to 26 feet depending on the level of the land. While the highly polished poles are meant to visually mark the undulations of the landscape, their primary function is to attract lightning, especially during lightning storm season in late summer when lightning strikes the rods and illuminates the installation. De Maria's use of a precise grid format is drawn from Minimalism, but the viewer's experience will depend on a number of environmental factors outside of the artist's control. For example, the work's visual impact is based on fluctuations in weather and the change of seasons; the piece would lose much of its attraction at times of the year when lightning is infrequent. As with most Earthworks, the site is remote and viewing is made more difficult by the requirement for viewers to stay overnight at cabins on site; no children are allowed. Much like Nancy Holt's Sun Tunnels, De Maria's work pairs fleeting moments of nature with the heroic materials of manmade industry.

<!-- 

In May 1982, with the help of Public Art Fund, Denes planted around two acres of wheat in downtown Manhattan at the old Battery Park Landfill. The process required digging 285 furrows in the ground, by hand. For four months, the artist and her assistants became agriculturalists, tending their plants: ultra-American, amber waves of grain. Two blocks from Wall Street and just across the water from the Statue of Liberty, their urban garden thrived. The project’s title, Wheatfield—A Confrontation, nodded at the tension between the field and the city behind it.

Denes’s idea, she told the New York Times back in 1982, was “an intrusion of the country into the metropolis, the world’s richest real estate.” At the time, the piece was as much a critique of the economy and the city’s real estate system as it was a protest for environmental awareness. According to the artist’s website, the land that comprised the literal trash heap under her field was valued at $4.5 billion. The land has since been built up and developed into Battery Park City.
