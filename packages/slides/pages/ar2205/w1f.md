## Whom Are You Writing For?

<!--  

imagine your audience:
- fellow students
- instructors
- general public
- specialists in the field
- museum visitors
- online readers

(an skeptical reader is a useful exercise)

ex.:
you will not explain that the Virgin Mary was the mother of Jesus—you can probably assume that your reader has at least this much knowledge of Christianity—but if you mention St. Anne, you probably will explain that St. Anne was the mother of Mary.


• how much background you need to give • which terms you need to define • what kinds of evidence you need to offer in order to convince the reader • what degree of detail you need to go into.

### A Checklist for the Audience:

- Do I have a sense of what the reader probably knows about the issue? 
- Do I have a sense of what the reader probably thinks about the issue? 
-  Have I stated my thesis clearly and sufficiently early in the essay?
-  How much common ground do we probably share? 
-  Have I, in the paper, tried to establish common ground and then moved on to advance my position? 
-  Have I supported my arguments with sufficient details? 
- Have I used the appropriate language (for instance, defined terms that are likely to be unfamiliar)? 
- I indicated why my readers should care about the issue and should accept or at least take seriously my views? 
- Is the organization clear? 
- Have I used transitions (“furthermore,” “on the other hand”) where they are needed?
