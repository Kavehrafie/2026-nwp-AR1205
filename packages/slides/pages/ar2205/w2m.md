## Whom Are You Writing For?

<!--  

imagine your audience:
- fellow students
- instructors
- general public
- specialists in the field
- museum visitors
- online readers

(an skeptical reader is a useful exercise)

ex.:
you will not explain that the Virgin Mary was the mother of Jesus—you can probably assume that your reader has at least this much knowledge of Christianity—but if you mention St. Anne, you probably will explain that St. Anne was the mother of Mary.


• how much background you need to give • which terms you need to define • what kinds of evidence you need to offer in order to convince the reader • what degree of detail you need to go into.

 -->

---

### A Checklist for the Audience:

- Do I have a sense of what the reader probably knows about the issue? 
- Do I have a sense of what the reader probably thinks about the issue? 
-  Have I stated my thesis clearly and sufficiently early in the essay?
-  How much common ground do we probably share? 
-  Have I, in the paper, tried to establish common ground and then moved on to advance my position? 
-  Have I supported my arguments with sufficient details? 
- Have I used the appropriate language (for instance, defined terms that are likely to be unfamiliar)? 
- I indicated why my readers should care about the issue and should accept or at least take seriously my views? 
- Is the organization clear? 
- Have I used transitions (“furthermore,” “on the other hand”) where they are needed?

### The Thesis Statement

<br>

<v-clicks>

- NOT the assertion of a fact
- NOT a statement of the obvious
- NOT a statement of purpose
- NOT a question
- NOT a plot summary
- NOT a statement of the artist's intention
- NOT a broad generalization
- NOT a statement of personal taste
</v-clicks>

### A Checklist for the Thesis Statement:

<div class="nodeco-list">

- [ ] Does my thesis make a claim that requires support?
- [ ] Is the claim arguable rather than self-evident, universally accepted, and of little interest?
- [ ] Can evidence be produced to support the claim? 
- [ ] Is the claim narrow enough to be convincingly supported in a paper written within the allotted time and of the assigned length?

"Modernity" means <u>contingency</u>. It points to a social order which has turned from the worship of ancestors and past authorities to the pursuit of a projected future — of goods, pleasures, freedoms, forms of control over nature, or infinities of information.

### Disputation of the Holy Sacrament
- commissioned as part of Raphael's work on the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican
- represents the Catholic Church's doctrine of transubstantiation, which holds that during the Eucharist, the bread and wine are transformed into the body and blood of Christ.
- The fresco is divided into two main sections: the heavenly realm above and the earthly realm below.
- In the heavenly realm, Christ is depicted at the center, surrounded by a host of saints, angels, and theologians engaged in a celestial debate about the nature of the Eucharist.
- In the earthly realm, a group of clergy and laypeople are gathered around an altar, witnessing the miracle of the Eucharist.

![Jacques-Louis David, _The Tennis Court Oath_, 1791, oil on canvas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg)

<!-- 
- The Tennis Court Oath was a pivotal event during the early stages of the French Revolution. On June 20, 1789, members of the Third Estate, who represented the common people of France, found themselves locked out of a meeting of the Estates-General. In response, they gathered in a nearby indoor tennis court and took an oath not to disband until they had drafted a new constitution for France.
- The painting captures the moment when the members of the Third Estate, led by figures such as Jean-Sylvain Bailly and Maximilien Robespierre, are shown raising their hands in unison as they take the oath. The scene is filled with a sense of determination and unity among the revolutionaries.
- David's composition emphasizes the collective action of the Third Estate, portraying them as a powerful force for change. The figures are arranged in a dynamic and dramatic manner, with strong diagonal lines leading the viewer's eye toward the central figures taking the oath.
- The Tennis Court Oath is a significant historical event that marked the beginning of the French Revolution and the eventual overthrow of the monarchy.
- The representatives of the Third Estate, the church, and the nobility each had one vote

### symbolism of Marat's death
- Marat was a radical journalist and politician during the French Revolution, known for his fiery writings and advocacy for the rights of the common people.
- Marat suffered from a debilitating skin condition that required him to spend much of his time in a medicinal bath.
- On July 13, 1793, Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday, a Girondin sympathizer who believed that killing Marat would help restore peace to France.
- In the painting, David portrays Marat as a martyr-like figure, emphasizing his sacrifice for the revolutionary cause. Marat is depicted in a serene and almost saintly manner, with his head tilted back and eyes closed, suggesting a sense of transcendence.
- The composition of the painting is stark and simple, with a limited color palette dominated by dark tones. The use of light and shadow creates a dramatic effect, highlighting Marat's figure against the dark background.
- The painting also includes symbolic elements, such as the letter in Marat's hand, which is believed to be from Corday, and the quill pen, symbolizing Marat's role as a writer and propagandist.



### TJ Clark on _The Death of Marat_
Clark’s argument about David’s Death of Marat is that the painting marks a turning point where art becomes inseparable from revolutionary politics and historical time. He sees it as an emblem of modernism’s birth because:

- Temporal rupture: The painting is tied to “Year II” of the French Revolution, signaling a new calendar and a radical break with the past. Art is no longer timeless; it is embedded in political time.
- Material and ideological stakes: Marat’s body, rendered with stark realism, embodies the Revolution’s promise and violence. Clark argues that David uses paint to make political martyrdom tangible, aligning representation with revolutionary ideals.
- Crisis of representation: The work dramatizes the tension between art’s autonomy and its political function. It’s not just commemorative—it asks whether painting can still serve truth when history itself is unstable.
- Modernism’s origin: For Clark, this moment inaugurates modernism as a condition of uncertainty, where art must grapple with social upheaval and ideological collapse rather than eternal beauty.

### Bohemian
- An individual who lives an unconventional lifestyle, often in the company of like-minded people, with few permanent ties.
- the artists withdrawing from bourgeois society to lead an independent, nonconformist life. 
- how bohemianism was associated with modernism and avant-garde art movements: 
- Artists and writers sought to break free from traditional norms and societal expectations, embracing new forms of expression and experimentation. 
- Bohemian communities often formed in urban areas, where artists could collaborate, share ideas, and support each other's creative endeavors.
- The term "bohemian" has its roots in the French word "bohémien," which was used to describe the Romani people, who were mistakenly believed to have come from the Bohemia region of Central Europe. Over time, the term evolved to refer to artists and intellectuals who lived unconventional lives.
- the bohemian way of living was contradicted by the commercialization of art and the rise of consumer culture in the 20th century. Thus artists had enjoyed a certain degree of freedom and nonconformity, but they also had to navigate the pressures of the art market and the demands of patrons and collectors.

give me a few examples of famous bohemian artists and writers from the 19th and 20th centuries, along with a brief description of their contributions to art and culture.
- Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864–1901): A French painter and illustrator known for his depictions of Parisian nightlife, particularly in the Montmartre district. His work captured the bohemian spirit of the era and influenced the development of modern art.
- Paul Gauguin (1848–1903): A Post-Impressionist painter who sought to escape the constraints of European society by traveling to Tahiti. His vibrant, exotic works challenged traditional artistic conventions and inspired future generations of artists.
- Emile Bernard (1868–1941): A French painter and printmaker associated with the Symbolist movement. He was known for his bold use of color and his rejection of academic art standards, embodying the bohemian ethos. He moved to the South of France and Brittany, where he associated with other avant-garde artists such as Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.

![Paul Cezanne, Still Life with Apples and Peaches, c. 1905, oil on canvas](https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5c394976-ec50-4c25-9c36-a39365a5fffe/full/!2560,1440/0/default.jpg)


<!-- 

Clark’s discussion of Cézanne’s still lifes focuses on how they embody the tension between materiality and meaning, which he sees as central to modernism. Here are the key points:


Objects as unstable presences: Cézanne’s apples, bottles, and cloth are not arranged to create harmony or narrative. Instead, they seem precarious, almost sliding off the table. Clark argues this instability reflects a world where permanence and order are in question.


Paint as matter: He emphasizes Cézanne’s brushwork — thick, hesitant, layered — which makes paint itself a subject. The still life becomes less about depicting objects and more about exploring the act of seeing and making.


Time and perception: Clark suggests Cézanne’s still lifes register time as a slow, uncertain process. They resist the instantaneity of Impressionism and instead convey duration, as if the objects and the painter’s gaze are locked in a long negotiation.


Modernist crisis: For Clark, these works dramatize the breakdown of traditional representation. They don’t offer symbolic meaning or ideal beauty; they stage a struggle between form and dissolution, echoing the philosophical and social uncertainties of the late 19th century.

<!--
- Paper is flat, but Braque has used shading to indicate creases and the bowing of the page.
- trompe l’oeil
- Braque painted a green curtain and a palette hanging from a nail. Both of these objects refer to traditional naturalistic representation. The curtain is a conventional framing device used in European painting to suggest spatial depth.

#### Cubism and Collectivity
In this chapter, Clark examines how Cubism—starting with Picasso and Braque—reconceives painting as a collective temporal and perceptual enterprise. He explores how multiple viewpoints, fractured forms, and the breaking down of linear perspective reflect a growing awareness of societal and aesthetic fragmentation. Cubism becomes a visual metaphor for modern life’s collective subjectivities amid a crumbling old order.

- 20feet tall (6 meters) model of the Monument to the Third International (1919-20)
- Had the full-scale project been built it would have been 1,300 feet (400 meters) tall, making it the tallest structure in the world at that time, surpassing the Eiffel Tower by more than 100 feet (30 meters).
- it was to be constructed from industrial materials such as iron, glass, and steel, and would have been a dynamic structure with rotating sections that symbolized the forward movement of the proletariat.
- the units (glass cylinder, cube and cone) were housing conferences, meetings, and exhibitions related to the activities of the Comintern (an organization devoted to international communist revolution).
  - They were also to revolve at different speeds: the glass cylinder once a year, the cube once a month, and the cone once a day. 
- after the revolution, Tatlin adapted his philosophy of nature-of-materials to the concept of productive art (rational utilitarian objects for mass production). designing workers' uniforms, furniture, and other utilitarian objects.

The book was written after the Fall of the Wall. That is, at a moment when there was general agreement, on the part of masses and elites in most of the world, that the project called <span v-mark.red="{at: 1}">socialism</span> had come to an end---at roughly the same time, it seems, as the project called <span v-mark.red>modernism</span>. ... something of socialism and modernism has died, in both cases deservedly; ... If they died together, does that mean in some sense they lived together, in century-long co-dependence?

The Fall of the Berlin Wall and the End of History (1989)

### End of History 

- The phrase "The End of History" was popularized by political philosopher Francis Fukuyama in his 1989 essay and subsequent 1992 book, "The End of History and the Last Man."
- Fukuyama argued that with the end of the Cold War and the apparent triumph of liberal democracy and capitalism, humanity had reached the "end point" of its ideological evolution.
- He suggested that liberal democracy had emerged as the final and most successful form of government, and that there were no viable alternatives left to challenge it.

### leading to the Iraq-War
- the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States, which led to the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the Iraq War in 2003.
