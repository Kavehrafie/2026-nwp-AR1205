lead to at least two ostensibly contradictory directions (1. formalism) (2. a performative erasure of distinction between art and life.)

Trend: Joselit recognizes a shift in the 1950s and 1960s: "in which the artist's gesture is displaced by medium-based processes ans systems." (37) Adding to it also language and text. Also discussing Morris Louis, he makes the remark: "the physics of motion appears to have engulfed human gesture." (37)


### Louis's process
When Louis began making his large Unfurled paintings in 1960, their dimensions often made it impossible for him to extend the canvasses fully in his small studio—the dining room of his Washington, D.C., home. Similarly, few galleries were large enough to accommodate them, and only two of the more than one hundred in this series were exhibited before the artist died in 1962. Although Louis painted on a vast scale, the brightly colored ribbons of paint cascading down the sides of this canvas invite a close look. Perhaps even more remarkable than the immense size of this work is the broad expanse of raw canvas Louis left exposed—an emphatic void framed by exuberant color.

#### Gestalt Psychology ✏️
</div>

<!--
Albers ws for instance very much interested in Gestalt psychology, and this led him towards an exploration of the effects of optical illusion.

Later he was drawn  towards a study of the ways in which colors act upom on another.

Gestalt psychology is a theory of mind that proposes that the operational principle of the brain is holistic, parallel, and analog, with self-organizing tendencies. The principle maintains that the human eye sees objects in their entirety before perceiving their individual parts, suggesting that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

- structured accorsing to a grid and composed of virtually monochromic, close-valued red squares and rectangles.viewer's perception
- the example of Reinhardt might therefore suggest that non-compositional painting is the twin of Abstact Expressionism's gestural excess.

By 1952, Reinhardt’s compositions were severe grids. Though the two mirrored T-shaped motifs somewhat obscure the gridded arrangement, this composition is divided evenly into three vertical bands and seven horizontal bands. Through the work’s subtle tonal variations, Reinhardt explores the spatial effects of the color red. Its warmer hues appear to push out toward the viewer and almost hover before the painting’s surface, while its cooler hues appear to withdraw and recede. The artist’s brushwork is so subtle that traces of his hand are nearly impossible to perceive. His polemical paintings, writings, and comics divided his peers and audience sharply in the 1950s, but in the following decade he became one of the strongest influences on the younger generations of Minimalist and Conceptual artists

#### Stain Painting ✏️
</div>

<!--
**Staining painting**: a more autonomous gesturality in which dields of paint seemed to compose themeselves with relatively littel intervention by the artist.

#### Mountains and Sea
Her first major work, Mountains and Sea (1952), was created by pouring thinned paint onto an unprimed canvas laid flat on the floor. The paint soaked into the fabric, staining it with areas of color that seemed to emerge organically rather than being applied deliberately. This technique allowed Frankenthaler to explore the fluidity of paint and the interaction between color and surface in a new way. 
- This technique allowed the fluidity of the medium ti generate both contour of the painting's elements and a distinctive  halo encircling each them, resulting from the uneven bleeding of the medium into absorbed canvas.

<!-- 

Morris, after seeing Frankenthaler's work in 1953, adopted her staining technique, modifying it by using thinned synthetic polymer paints (acrylics) that had only recently become available. Louis poured the fluid paint onto unprimed canvases, allowing it to soak into the fabric and create large fields of color with soft, diffuse edges. 

Pouring thined paint over a canvas raised and gently folded into a kind of funnel. 

Trend: Joselit recognizes a shift in the 1950s and 1960s: "in which the artist's gesture is displaced by medium-based processes ans systems." (37) Also discussing Morris Louis, he makes the remark: "the physics of motion appears to have engulfed human gesture." (37)

In 1953 Morris Louis visited the studio of Helen Frankenthaler, where he saw Mountains and Sea (1952), the first painting made with her signature “soak-stain” technique. This method of collapsing color into canvas by manipulating thinned acrylic washes into the unprimed cotton fabric had an immediate impact on Louis, who would translate it into his own idiom in a series of poured paintings created by gravity-pulled streams of luminescent color. 

### Louis's process
When Louis began making his large Unfurled paintings in 1960, their dimensions often made it impossible for him to extend the canvasses fully in his small studio—the dining room of his Washington, D.C., home. Similarly, few galleries were large enough to accommodate them, and only two of the more than one hundred in this series were exhibited before the artist died in 1962. Although Louis painted on a vast scale, the brightly colored ribbons of paint cascading down the sides of this canvas invite a close look. Perhaps even more remarkable than the immense size of this work is the broad expanse of raw canvas Louis left exposed—an emphatic void framed by exuberant color.

<!-- 

These works, which he referred to as Veils, established Louis’s mature style and aligned his work with that of other Color Field painters, such as Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and Clyfford Still at a moment when, for the first time since Impressionism, pure opticality held primacy over content and form.

In Morris's works it is the direction of the poured paint, drawn by gravity rather than the artist's own propulsove force

<!-- 
- Twombly another approcah to Post-Painterly Abstraction: in the mid-1950s dramatizes the agonistic relationship between canvas and mark
- something original. 
- scrawled with crayon, pencil, and pastel. 
- no paint but pencil. Something original on a cheap peiece of cloth not a canvas. doodle on canvas elides artist's gesture with the anonymous social language of graffiti.
- For Louis and Frankenthaler: artist's genture dissolves into an autonomous medium-based process. For Twombly: artist's gesture is elided with an anonymous social language of graffiti, writing (nonlegible). 2 orientations
- In place of grand painterly acts emerging  from authentic psychic need are decidedly anti-heroic, furtive scrawlings reminiscent of annonymous communications on bathroom walls. (the desublimated impulses of graffiti)

![Ellsworth Kelly. Colors for a Large Wall. 1951. Oil on canvas, 64 panels, 7' 10 1/2" × 7' 10 1/2" (240 × 240 cm).](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1768848193/2026nwp-ar2205/369b0742a94f46461ae58814e3bd28aed4f15bf2-3000x2988_xpytn7.jpg)

<!-- 

### Regarding Chance

Colors For A Large Wall is the painting that Ellsworth Kelly considered his masterpiece from the few years that he spent in France in the late '40s and early 1950s as a young American on the G.I. bill. The way this painting came about has its origin in a set of eight collages that Kelly called Spectrum Colors Arranged By Chance. And you see a couple of those on the wall nearby.

For those, he bought huge supplies of the colored adhesive paper that you could buy in art supply stores in Paris, He made these collages, randomly distributing the 18 colors according to mathematical systems that he devised for each one. And then when all of those collages were finished he had some leftover squares.

He decided to make a couple of small collages with those leftover squares to make a couple of small collages, including the one that we see on the wall that's just eight squares across and eight squares down. As you can see, there's a lot of white because Kelly didn't have all that many color squares left.

He said it perplexed him. And in the end, he decided he was going to make a painting. and made Colors For A Large Wall.

Not artist's personal touch but idiosyncratic determination of procedures of selection and organization. Artist choose a system of randomness and then follows through with it.

"non-compositional painting" according to Yves Bois

### Hard-Edge ✏️
</div>

<!--
The term ‘hard-edge painting’ was coined by Californian critic Jules Langsner in 1959. He used it to describe the work of those abstract painters, particularly on the West Coast of America, who reacted to the more painterly or gestural forms of abstract expressionism by adopting a consciously impersonal approach to paint application. Their paintings were made up of monochromatic fields of clean-edged colour which reinforced the flatness of the picture surface.

This style of hard-edged geometric abstraction refers back to the work of Piet Mondrian and Josef Albers. It can be seen as a subdivision of post-painterly abstraction, which in turn emerged from colour field painting.

<!-- 

This painting consists of two identical vertical sets of concentric, inverted U-shapes. Each half contains twelve stripes of black enamel paint that seem to radiate from the single vertical unpainted line at their center. With this "regulated pattern," Stella explained, he forced "illusionistic space out of the painting at a constant rate." Working freehand, he applied the commercial black enamel paint with a housepainter's brush; slight irregularities are visible. Stella made this painting for MoMA's exhibition Sixteen Americans in 1959, at which time the Museum purchased it.
