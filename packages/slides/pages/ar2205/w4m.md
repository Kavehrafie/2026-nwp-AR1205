### TWO APPROACHES IN POSTWAR AFRICAN MODERNISM

:: right :: 


:: left :: 

<!-- 

"The first, an extension of international modernism, was led mostly by artist who, after extensive training and sojourn in Europe, saw themselves as part of an internaional modern art world rather than as champions of any specifically African or national stylistic identity. The second resulted form the work of European art teachers, such as the Belgian Pierre Romain-Desfossés, the French Pierre Lods, and Frank Mc Ewen from Britian who---beliving in the African's innate, special artistic abilities---encouraged their students to create work without looking to either European or indigenous African predcedents. The resulting work, according to its protagonists, represented the most authentic expression of modern African art, since it was not inflenced by learnt or imposed ideas and methods"

<!-- 
The bgining of modernism in Egypt traced back to the first graduates of the School of Fine Arts in Cairo, established in 1908. The school played a crucial role in nurturing a generation of Egyptian artists who would go on to shape the country's modern art scene. In the post-war period, Egyptian artists began to gain international recognition through their participation in various exhibitions abroad. Notable among these were the Venice Biennale (1952), the São Paulo

Neophraonism a style that emerged in Egypt during the mid-20th century, blending elements of ancient Egyptian art with modernist techniques. Artists associated with this movement sought to create a unique visual language that reflected Egypt's rich cultural heritage while engaging with contemporary artistic trends.

### Egypt Awakening (1928)
His most famous work, Egyptian Awakening depicting an unveiling peasnat woman accompanied by a waking sphinx, symbolizes the political vision of nationalist who won partial independence from Britian in 1922, and served as the high point of the neo-pharaonic movement in modern Egyptian art.

### Collective
Mukhtar and several of his contemporaries, such as Raghib Ayyad, Mohammad Naghi and Mahmud Said, formed the group La Chimere to consolidate their vision of Egyptian modernism in 1927.

<!-- 

in 1947, a group formed called Group of Modern Art based at the Institute of Pedagy, Cairo joining in rejecting both elitism associated with the school of finr arts and art et liberte's avant-garde. Looking inward, the Group of Modern Art, led by Gamal al-Sigini, Hamed Oweis, and Gazbia Sirry embraced the revolutionary nationalism that came in the wake of July 1952 revolution.
- Their work often depicted the struggles of everyday Egyptians, particularly peasants and workers, aligning with the social realist movement. they mixed social realism with Egyptian folk imagery and Copic figuration
- The group was short lived but brought modernism in alignment with political rhetoric and practice if decolonization and cultural nationalism.
  
### The Egyptian Revolution of 1952
- The Egyptian revolution of 1952,[3] also known as the 1952 coup d'état[4][5][6] and the 23 July Revolution,[7] was a period of profound political, economic, and societal change in Egypt. On 23 July 1952, the revolution began with the toppling of King Farouk in a coup d'état by the Free Officers Movement, a group of army officers led by Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser

Naser's pan-Arabism and socialism greatly influenced Egyptian art during this period, as artists sought to reflect the ideals of unity, social justice, and national pride in their work.

pan-Arabism is an ideology espousing the unification of the countries of North Africa and West Asia from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Sea, referred to as the Arab world. It is based on the premise that the peoples of the Arab world constitute a single nation.

<!-- 

### Tunisian Modernism
- The School of Tunis founded in 1949 by a group of Tunisian artists led by Pierre Boucherle and Yahia Turki
- Sought to create a modern Tunisian art style by blending local traditions with European modernism
- Emphasized themes of national identity, daily life, and landscapes
- Not a formal school but a movement that influenced many Tunisian artists in the mid-20th century

#### Matisse in Morocco
- When Henri Matisse arrived in Tangier in the winter of 1912.
- The artist arrived in Morocco not because of yearning or the thirst for exotics and adventures — he received a commission connected with Africa. Russian collector Sergei Shchukin commissioned him to paint several pictures with Moroccan motifs and hinted that he would like to see people on them. At the same time, Matisse thought that it would be nice to finally fulfill another long-standing commission from another Russian, Ivan Morozov.
-  Finding models wasn’t an easy task: only with the help of his friends and hotel owners he persuaded a 12-year-old brothel employee Zorah and a hotel groom Amido to pose for him.
- This work is the portrait of a young Moroccan woman from Tangier, crouching on a carpet in the shade of the walls bordering a terrace, with a bowl of goldfish next to her. Part of a set sometimes called the Moroccan Triptych, this work belonged to the collection of Ivan Morozov until 1919.

![Hatem El Mekki, _La Femme et le Coq_, the 1950s](https://res.cloudinary.com/image-solar/image/upload/v1769785946/el-mekki_gwcr5t.jpg)

<!-- 

Hatem El Mekki was born in Batavia (currently Jakarta) and attended Le lycée Carnot de Tunis, where he mastered the Chinese aquarelle technique, before travelling to Paris on a government scholarship. In Paris, he was an artist-in-residence at the prestigious Cité Internationale des Arts, and during this time there produced illustrations, worked in film, and collaborated with the French magazine Marianne. 

His work La Femme et le Coq (1950s) shows a woman holding a cockerel in her arms, set against a stark black background. The female figure and the bird are both rendered as mere silhouettes, distinguished only by a white chalk-like outline and a red wattle on the cockerel’s head. The woman looks directly at the viewer, her eyes wide open and her arms – executed in a hurried, almost macabre manner – grasp at the bird. In many cultures, the cockerel is considered a symbol of hope and a new dawn, and in the context of El Mekki’s painting can be read as signalling Tunisia’s liberation from the French colonial protectorate in a process that took place between 1952 and 1956.
- Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956, leading to a surge in national pride and cultural expression. Artists like El Mekki played a crucial role in shaping the visual identity of the newly independent nation.

"After Tunisia won its political independence from France in 1956, discussion about the task of modern artists shifted to the development of authentic formal styles informed by indidenuous craft and Arab design. It was no longer enough to simply depit Tunisian themes using dated European avant-garde modes."

Moroccan Modernism
- the establishment of the Escula de Belles Artes in Tetouan in 1945 by Spanish artist Mariano Bertuchi
  - The school played a crucial role in nurturing Moroccan artists and promoting modern art in the country.
  - Prominent Moroccan modernist artists include Ahmed Yacoubi, Farid Belkahia, and Mohamed Melehi
  - These artists blended traditional Moroccan art forms with contemporary styles, creating a unique modernist expression that reflected Morocco's cultural heritage and contemporary realities.
- the Ecole des Beaux-Arts de Casablanca founded in 1950 by French artist Jean Carzou
  - The school became a hub for artistic innovation and experimentation in Morocco.
  - Notable artists associated with the school include Mohamed Chabâa, Mohamed El Baz, and Ahmed Cherkaoui
  - These artists explored new techniques and styles, often incorporating elements of Moroccan culture and identity into their work.

### Morocco independence in 1956 from France and Spain
- after independence, Moroccan artists sought to assert their national identity through art, often drawing on berber and islamic artistic traditions
- berber visual culture for inspiration (berber are indigenous people of north africa they are also called amazigh and living in morocco algeria tunisia libya mali niger and egypt)

### Ahmed Cherkaoui (1934-1967)
A prominent modernist artist in North Africa, Ahmed Cherkaoui drew on a spectrum of signs and shapes derived from the folk art and national heritage of Morocco. The calligraphy he learned at Quranic school and his mother’s traditional Amazigh tattoos that he encountered at a young age both formed part of his visual language, while later he was influenced by artists including Roger Bissière and Paul Klee, and the Art Informel movement. After studying graphics at the École des Metiers d’Art de Paris from 1956 to 1959, Cherkaoui spent a year at Warsaw’s Academy of Fine Arts in 1961 and held his first solo show in Paris at the Atelier de Lucienne Thalheimer. Using a range of materials that included surfaces such as burlap, Cherkaoui’s attention to tactility, colour, line and shape hint at the essential elements of different sign systems. Numerous retrospective exhibitions have been organised, including at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris in 1996 and regularly at the Salon de Mai in Paris.

<!-- 

Farid Belkahia, Mohamed Melehi, and Mohamed Chabâa were key figures in the Casablanca School, an influential art movement that emerged in Morocco during the 1960s. The movement sought to challenge traditional artistic conventions and promote a new form of modernism that was rooted in Moroccan culture and identity.

### Casablanca School
- Founded in the 1960s by a group of Moroccan artists including Mohamed Melehi, Farid Belkahia, and Mohamed Chabâa
- Emphasized the use of traditional Moroccan motifs and techniques in contemporary art
- Sought to create a distinctly Moroccan modernism that reflected the country's cultural heritage and contemporary realities
- The Casablanca School played a crucial role in shaping
- Shortly after joining the teaching staff of the Casablanca Art School in 1964, Mohamed Melehi insisted that all the Greco-Roman busts be removed from the studios — and all the plaster casts of classical sculptures, too. These were to be replaced by a selection of rugs made by Berber women.
- 
### presence plastique exhibition (1969)
Belkahia was always looking for new horizons. In 1969, he and his colleagues took art to the streets, with a now-legendary outdoor exhibition known as Présence Plastique, held first in Marrakech’s main square, the Jemaa el-Fnaa, and then in Casablanca’s 16 November Square. (Both iterations lasted a fortnight.)

The idea was to make art an everyday part of Moroccan life, in contrast to state-organised exhibitions such as the Salon du Printemps, which were attended predominantly by a social elite. As the six exhibiting artists explained in a joint statement in Souffles, a journal affiliated with the school, they wished to ‘awaken the average person’s curiosity, his critical spirit, to stimulate him so that he integrates new plastic expressions into the rhythm of his life, into his daily space’.

<!--
They openly acknowledged the Casablanca Art School’s debt to its German predecessor, the Bauhaus — specifically the interdisciplinary approach whereby art, craft and design were all taught under the one roof.

The trio were also aware of the experiments in abstraction being carried out in the West, some of which were ostensibly not dissimilar to their own. Melehi’s work, in particular, shows an affinity with hard-edge painting, which was popular in the US in the 1960s, exemplified by the likes of Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly.

![Ibrahim El-Salahi, Reborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams, enamel and oil on cotton, 258.8 x 260 cm](https://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Salahi.jpg)

<!-- 

A group of harrowing, evanescent figures approaches the viewer, some occupying the full height of the canvas. Their limbs are elongated and skeletal, and their mask-like faces are accented by hollow, circular eyes. Upturned crescent shapes sit atop their heads, reminiscent of bull’s horns or celestial symbols, giving them a sense of timeless power. Yet, the figures’ lower bodies seem to gradually fade into the background, transforming into abstract shapes like circles, lines, and hooks. Along the lower register, atmospheric mists of sandy and ashen tones disturb the limits of the figures’ outer contours—and all depicted forms seem to move fluidly between positive and negative space.

This piece is typical of the artist’s work from the early-to-mid 1960s. El-Salahi uses an earthy color palette that invokes the region’s natural environment, and blends elements of modernist abstraction with a number of motifs drawn from the breadth of Sudanese cultural histories: the elegance of Arabic calligraphy, the attenuated forms of sub-Saharan figural sculpture, and aspects of ancient Nubian art.


### El-Salahi's journey
- attend the Slade School of Fine Art in London in the mid-1950s.
- When he returned to Sudan in 1957, El-Salahi suddenly found himself feeling disconnected from his home country. He realized that his Western training had alienated him from the concerns and visual expressions of the community he grew up in.

\[T\]his radically changed attitude, the attitude of an extravagant, conceited young artist fresh from London, actually just hemmed me in. Over time, I came to see that conditions in Sudan required a very different approach on the part of the artist, who would otherwise be completely isolated from his audience. If I was to have a relationship with an audience, I had to examine the Sudanese environment, identify what it offered, assess its potential as an artistic resource and explore its possibilities as a complementary element in artistic creation.

<!-- 
Adopting a subdued and somber color palette that is representative of the desert landscape of northern Sudan, the artist would gradually expand his experimentation to include art forms beyond Arabic calligraphy. The lines and hooks, associated with kufic writing, soon morphed into other forms: ghostly figures, animals, and vegetal motifs came to populate his compositions, as well as concentric linear patterns that the artist associated with sonic waves. In one of his most abstract canvases from this period, The Last Sound (1964) he represents the Islamic prayers for the dying, which accompany the soul’s passage between life and death.

- what is mbari: Mbari is a traditional Igbo (people of southeastern Nigeria) art form that involves the creation of open-sided structures or shrines, often made from mud and decorated with sculptures and paintings. These structures are typically built to honor deities, ancestors, or significant cultural events. The Mbari Club in Ibadan was named after this art form, symbolizing a space for artistic expression and cultural celebration.

#### Lawrence's Mbari Series ✏️
- In 1964, African American artist Jacob Lawrence created a series of paintings inspired by his visit to the Mbari Club in Ibadan, Nigeria. The Mbari Club was a cultural center founded by Ulli Beier that served as a hub for artists, writers, and intellectuals from Nigeria and other parts of Africa. Lawrence's series captures the vibrant atmosphere of the club and the broader cultural renaissance taking place in Nigeria during the post-colonial period.


Painted and drawn with areas of flat, vibrant colors, we look slightly down onto a bustling street market in this stylized, horizontal scene. It is created almost entirely with shades of sky and royal blue, buttercup and harvest yellow, caramel and ash brown, and spearmint green with only a few touches of brick and crimson red. The people all have black-colored skin with their features outlined in white. They sit, stand, gather, or walk along stalls lining the street that extends away from us. Some wear caps, headdresses, or are bareheaded. They wear wraps or togas that mostly leave arms bare. Some carry goods on their heads, sit and eat, hold children and babies, or reach for wares. One person holds a white chicken and another leads a couple of goats along the street. The inverted, narrow V of the street meets the shallow V of the rooflines of the buildings or awnings of the stalls just above the center of the composition. The upside-down triangular filling the distant area between the rooflines has a dark yellow ground where densely packed tables, carts, buildings, people, and several chickens are tiny in scale. A strip of blue along the top edge of the painting suggests the sky above. The artist signed and dated the work in graphite in the lower right corner, “Jacob Lawrence 64.”


#### Ibrahim El-Salahi at Mbari ✏️
- In 1962, Ibrahim El-Salahi visited the Mbari Club in Ibadan, Nigeria, where he was exposed to a vibrant community of African artists and intellectuals.

<!-- 
- Onabolu is credited with introducing formal art education in Nigeria and advocating for the recognition of African artists within the global art community.
- His work often depicted Nigerian subjects using Western techniques, blending local themes with European styles.
- Onabolu's efforts laid the groundwork for future generations of Nigerian artists, contributing to the development of modern art in Nigeria.
- Academicism in Nigerian art: Onabolu's style was characterized by a strong adherence to academic principles of art, which emphasized realism, proportion, and perspective. This approach was in contrast to the more traditional African art forms that were prevalent in Nigeria at the time.
- Nigerian elite patrons like European-style portraits

From 1967 to 1970, Nigeria’s brutal civil war, known as the Nigerian-Biafran War, tore apart the newly independent nation with economic, ethnic, cultural, and religious conflict. 

After the war, Okeke joined the faculty of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he ran the Department of Fine and Applied Arts from 1971 to 1983. Under his direction, Nsukka rose to prominence as a center of Nigeria’s artistic creativity, drawing artists like the renowned El Anatsui to its ranks. At Nsukka, Okeke further developed his synthesis theory, encouraging students to research Nigerian art traditions to solve formal problems in their work. The artist’s own experiments with uli became increasingly abstract in prints like Isi Nwoji where uli motifs, like the diamond-shaped kola nut (isioji), are clearly defined but with a bolder graphic approach.

### uli

drew inspiration for a new visual language from uli, an Igbo female body and wall painting tradition from southeastern Nigeria that is based on sinuous abstract forms derived from nature. In uli, Okeke saw “limitless expression,” internalizing the drawing technique he learned from his mother, a renowned uli draughtswoman, to serve a modernist sensibility.

In 1939, the South African artist Ernest Mancoba turned toward abstraction for the first time. Although this artistic development has been associated with Mancoba’s relationship to the CoBrA movement, Joshua Cohen argues that his embrace of abstraction also can be read as a turn away from the burdens of representation imposed by patrons upon a black South African artist.

To stay alive—psychologically, creatively—the black South African sculptor and painter Ernest Mancoba (1904–2002) managed to leave home.1 On September 2, 1938, he boarded the SS Balmoral Castle in Cape Town, destined for Southampton, England.2 Mancoba’s berth on the steamship, and his concomitant personal and artistic rebirth, resulted from protracted negotiations with liberal patrons who finally agreed to fund a year of study in Paris.3 Many South African artists had already traveled to Paris and other European capitals since the nineteenth century,4 but Mancoba was the first black artist to do so. He would not revisit South Africa until after the end of apartheid, and would never live there again.

he made use of his time in London by visiting the African collections at the British Museum. Some two years earlier, Mancoba had first encountered canonical West and Central African sculpture in a library in Cape Town, in the pages of a lavishly illustrated book entitled Primitive Negro Sculpture.8 Despite its unfortunate title, the book’s discovery in Cape Town marked a turning point for the young artist because it catalyzed his embrace of modernism, which to him meant a rough geometric aesthetic modeled on African sculpture

oon after arriving in Paris on September 27, Mancoba began attending classes at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, where he befriended several artists associated with the Danish Abstract Surrealist group Linien: Christian Poulsen (1911–1991), Ejler Bille (1910–2004), and Sonja Ferlov (1911–1984).15 Communicating in English, Mancoba and the Danes shared an outsider status in Paris, as well as common interests in modernism and African sculpture.

### universalism
Whereas Euro-American art genealogies tend to be discussed in terms of ideas and imagination, tout court, art from outside that realm still often gets pegged to artists’ identities, and framed as the product of experiences marked as “other.” Some black artists historically have responded to such formulas by seeking to evade them, notably by way of abstraction. In noting that Mancoba’s 1939 watercolors anticipated abstract art among African-descended modernists elsewhere, the lesson is not one of establishing precedence but rather of seeing parallels across contexts—including a perennial insistence on pigeonholing artists of color, irrespective of the nature of their work. Wherever the artist seeks to escape compartmentalization, the critic or scholar works at cross-purposes by qualifying his/her abstraction as “African” or “black.”

<!-- 

In Composition, Macoba’s earliest painting, the mask-like, geometric form that would later recur in many of his works first appears. From the 1940s onwards, this mask would prove an aesthetic stepping-stone from pictorial realism to stylistic representation, and later to pure abstraction. The abstract, Mancoba believed, was familiar to African art objects, which seldom reflected the physical world and made no overture to naturalism. It was only a question of stripping down the residual elements that made such a mask recognisable as face, distilling its image to an essential form – a constellation of colours and marks. The resulting oscillation between the figurative and abstract in Mancoba’s work, had, as he suggested, “the capacity to unite in our vision the outward aspect with the inner significance.”
