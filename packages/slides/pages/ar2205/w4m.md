In 1939, the South African artist Ernest Mancoba turned toward abstraction for the first time. Although this artistic development has been associated with Mancoba’s relationship to the CoBrA movement, Joshua Cohen argues that his embrace of abstraction also can be read as a turn away from the burdens of representation imposed by patrons upon a black South African artist.

To stay alive—psychologically, creatively—the black South African sculptor and painter Ernest Mancoba (1904–2002) managed to leave home.1 On September 2, 1938, he boarded the SS Balmoral Castle in Cape Town, destined for Southampton, England.2 Mancoba’s berth on the steamship, and his concomitant personal and artistic rebirth, resulted from protracted negotiations with liberal patrons who finally agreed to fund a year of study in Paris.3 Many South African artists had already traveled to Paris and other European capitals since the nineteenth century,4 but Mancoba was the first black artist to do so. He would not revisit South Africa until after the end of apartheid, and would never live there again.

he made use of his time in London by visiting the African collections at the British Museum. Some two years earlier, Mancoba had first encountered canonical West and Central African sculpture in a library in Cape Town, in the pages of a lavishly illustrated book entitled Primitive Negro Sculpture.8 Despite its unfortunate title, the book’s discovery in Cape Town marked a turning point for the young artist because it catalyzed his embrace of modernism, which to him meant a rough geometric aesthetic modeled on African sculpture

oon after arriving in Paris on September 27, Mancoba began attending classes at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, where he befriended several artists associated with the Danish Abstract Surrealist group Linien: Christian Poulsen (1911–1991), Ejler Bille (1910–2004), and Sonja Ferlov (1911–1984).15 Communicating in English, Mancoba and the Danes shared an outsider status in Paris, as well as common interests in modernism and African sculpture.

### universalism
Whereas Euro-American art genealogies tend to be discussed in terms of ideas and imagination, tout court, art from outside that realm still often gets pegged to artists’ identities, and framed as the product of experiences marked as “other.” Some black artists historically have responded to such formulas by seeking to evade them, notably by way of abstraction. In noting that Mancoba’s 1939 watercolors anticipated abstract art among African-descended modernists elsewhere, the lesson is not one of establishing precedence but rather of seeing parallels across contexts—including a perennial insistence on pigeonholing artists of color, irrespective of the nature of their work. Wherever the artist seeks to escape compartmentalization, the critic or scholar works at cross-purposes by qualifying his/her abstraction as “African” or “black.”

### TWO APPROACHES IN POSTWAR AFRICAN MODERNISM

:: right :: 


:: left :: 

<!-- 

"The first, an extension of international modernism, was led mostly by artist who, after extensive training and sojourn in Europe, saw themselves as part of an internaional modern art world rather than as champions of any specifically African or national stylistic identity. The second resulted form the work of European art teachers, such as the Belgian Pierre Romain-Desfossés, the French Pierre Lods, and Frank Mc Ewen from Britian who---beliving in the African's innate, special artistic abilities---encouraged their students to create work without looking to either European or indigenous African predcedents. The resulting work, according to its protagonists, represented the most authentic expression of modern African art, since it was not inflenced by learnt or imposed ideas and methods"

<!-- 
The bgining of modernism in Egypt traced back to the first graduates of the School of Fine Arts in Cairo, established in 1908. The school played a crucial role in nurturing a generation of Egyptian artists who would go on to shape the country's modern art scene. In the post-war period, Egyptian artists began to gain international recognition through their participation in various exhibitions abroad. Notable among these were the Venice Biennale (1952), the São Paulo

Neophraonism a style that emerged in Egypt during the mid-20th century, blending elements of ancient Egyptian art with modernist techniques. Artists associated with this movement sought to create a unique visual language that reflected Egypt's rich cultural heritage while engaging with contemporary artistic trends.

### Egypt Awakening (1928)
His most famous work, Egyptian Awakening depicting an unveiling peasnat woman accompanied by a waking sphinx, symbolizes the political vision of nationalist who won partial independence from Britian in 1922, and served as the high point of the neo-pharaonic movement in modern Egyptian art.

### Collective
Mukhtar and several of his contemporaries, such as Raghib Ayyad, Mohammad Naghi and Mahmud Said, formed the group La Chimere to consolidate their vision of Egyptian modernism in 1927.

in 1947, a group formed called Group of Modern Art based at the Institute of Pedagy, Cairo joining in rejecting both elitism associated with the school of finr arts and art et liberte's avant-garde. Looking inward, the Group of Modern Art, led by Gamal al-Sigini, Hamed Oweis, and Gazbia Sirry embraced the revolutionary nationalism that came in the wake of July 1952 revolution.
- Their work often depicted the struggles of everyday Egyptians, particularly peasants and workers, aligning with the social realist movement. they mixed social realism with Egyptian folk imagery and Copic figuration
- The group was short lived but brought modernism in alignment with political rhetoric and practice if decolonization and cultural nationalism.
  
- The Egyptian revolution of 1952,[3] also known as the 1952 coup d'état[4][5][6] and the 23 July Revolution,[7] was a period of profound political, economic, and societal change in Egypt. On 23 July 1952, the revolution began with the toppling of King Farouk in a coup d'état by the Free Officers Movement, a group of army officers led by Mohamed Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser

Naser's pan-Arabism and socialism greatly influenced Egyptian art during this period, as artists sought to reflect the ideals of unity, social justice, and national pride in their work.

pan-Arabism is an ideology espousing the unification of the countries of North Africa and West Asia from the Atlantic Ocean to the Arabian Sea, referred to as the Arab world. It is based on the premise that the peoples of the Arab world constitute a single nation.
