<!-- 

- In 1969, German artist Hans Haacke made a work called "Grass Grows" presented at Cornell University. The work consisted of a patch of grass that was planted in a gallery space and allowed to grow freely. The grass was watered and cared for by the artist, but it was also subject to the natural forces of growth and decay. The work was meant to challenge traditional notions of art as a static object and to highlight the relationship between humans and nature.
- fast-growing rye, grew and died in the gallery space
- drawing analogy between the natural systems and sociological ones

two exhibitions:
- Information at MoMA, 1970 (Keystone McShine)
- Software at the Jewish Museum, 1970
- "Artists included in 'Information' and 'Software' took further step by redefining the artwork as a pure act of communication, often having little or nothing to do with trasitional aesthetics." (Joselit, 129)

With the sense of mobility and change that pervades their time, \[the exhibiting artists\] are interested in ways of rapidly exchanging ideas rather than emblaming the idea in an "object."

"Whould the fact the Governor Rockefeller has not denounced President Nixon's Indochina policy be a reason for you not to vote for him in November?"

- a poll of museum visitors about the museum's funding sources, which revealed that a majority of visitors were against the museum accepting funding from corporations that were involved in controversial activities, such as arms manufacturing and environmental pollution. The poll was displayed in the museum and sparked a public debate about the ethics of museum funding.

- how these technological ans social transformations intersect
- the Rockefeller family, which had a long history of philanthropy and support for the arts, but also had ties to the oil industry and other controversial business practices. 
- intended to shatter the presumed innocence or neutrality of the museum
- Haacke's conviction that the language of art is lodged within broader social and political conflicts.

<!-- 

- Sol LeWitt, 1968, ‘Buried Cube Containing an Object of Importance but Little Value’. — The burial of the cube reportedly took place in a local garden, but these photographs, referring again to the notion of the series or process, are the only proof that LeWitt’s actions actually took place. A conceptual piece, this work was produced shortly following the publication of LeWitt’s 1968 manifesto describing the new Conceptual art movement. In the manifesto, he declares, “The execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” LeWitt disengages himself from the work and takes a strong “death of the author” stance. However this is only “death of the author” as a craftsman, and “birth of the author” as idea-maker.
