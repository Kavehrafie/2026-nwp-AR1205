## Op Art ✏️
</div>


<!-- 

Op art, short for optical art, is a style of visual art that uses distorted or manipulated geometrical patterns, often to create optical illusions.[1] It began in the early 20th century, and was especially popular from the 1960s on,[2] the term "Op art" dating to 1964.

- Victor Vasarely’s Supernovae, 1959-61
- The vibrant colors and geometric shapes create a dynamic and visually stimulating composition. The use of contrasting colors and precise patterns gives the illusion of movement and depth, making the artwork appear to pulsate and shift as the viewer's eye moves across it. The title "Supernovae" suggests an explosive cosmic event, and the artwork captures that energy through its bold design and vibrant color palette. Vasarely's work is a prime example of Op art, which seeks to engage the viewer's perception and create a sense of movement and depth on a flat surface.

- Bridget Riley’s Movement in Squares, 1961
- The black and white pattern creates a strong optical illusion of movement, as the eye is drawn to the contrasting shapes and lines. The squares appear to be shifting and vibrating, creating a dynamic visual experience. The use of high contrast and precise geometric shapes is characteristic of Op art, which aims to engage the viewer's perception and create a sense of movement and depth on a flat surface.
- Op art and packaging design: The bold, eye-catching patterns of Op art have been used in packaging design to create visually striking products that stand out on shelves. The use of optical illusions can draw attention to the product and make it more memorable to consumers.

- Riley's work was featured in Vogue in 1965, highlighting her status as an internationally famous artist and the mainstream appeal of Op art during that time. The inclusion of her portrait in a fashion magazine like Vogue indicates the crossover between fine art and popular culture, and how Op art's visually engaging style resonated with a wide audience beyond just the art world.

## Neo-concretism in Brazil ✏️

</div>


<!-- 

The neo-concrete movement was a splinter group of the 1950s Brazilian concrete art movement, calling for a greater sensuality, colour and poetic feeling in concrete art. The neo-concretists were interested in the relationship between the artwork and the viewer, and they sought to create works that were more interactive and engaging. They believed that art should be a living experience, rather than a static object to be admired from a distance.

A rejecting the rationalism of concrete art, the neo-concretists embraced a more organic and intuitive approach to art-making. They were interested in exploring the emotional and psychological effects of art, and they sought to create works that would evoke a sense of wonder and delight in the viewer.

With the construction of the country’s new utopian capital, Brasilia and the formation of the São Paulo Biennial, young Brazilian artists were inspired to create art that drew on contemporary theories of cybernetics, gestalt psychology and the optical experiments of international artists like Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely.

Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, Am’lcar de Castro, Franz Weissmann, Reynaldo Jardim, Sergio de Camargo, Theon Spanudis and Ferreira Gullar were unhappy with the dogmatic approach of the concrete group, so published the neo-concrete manifesto in 1959. In 1960 Hélio Oiticica joined the group and his groundbreaking series of red and yellow painted hanging wood constructions effectively liberated colour into three-dimensional space.

- The coup:
  - In 1964, a military coup d'état overthrew President João Goulart (pronounced: zhoo-OWN gular ), leading to a 21-year dictatorship marked by political repression, censorship, and human rights abuses. The regime cracked down on dissent, including artists and intellectuals, many of whom were arrested, tortured, or forced into exile.
