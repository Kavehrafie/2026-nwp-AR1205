## Op Art ✏️
</div>


<!-- 

Op art, short for optical art, is a style of visual art that uses distorted or manipulated geometrical patterns, often to create optical illusions.[1] It began in the early 20th century, and was especially popular from the 1960s on,[2] the term "Op art" dating to 1964.

- Victor Vasarely’s Supernovae, 1959-61
- The vibrant colors and geometric shapes create a dynamic and visually stimulating composition. The use of contrasting colors and precise patterns gives the illusion of movement and depth, making the artwork appear to pulsate and shift as the viewer's eye moves across it. The title "Supernovae" suggests an explosive cosmic event, and the artwork captures that energy through its bold design and vibrant color palette. Vasarely's work is a prime example of Op art, which seeks to engage the viewer's perception and create a sense of movement and depth on a flat surface.

<!-- 
- Bridget Riley’s Movement in Squares, 1961
- The black and white pattern creates a strong optical illusion of movement, as the eye is drawn to the contrasting shapes and lines. The squares appear to be shifting and vibrating, creating a dynamic visual experience. The use of high contrast and precise geometric shapes is characteristic of Op art, which aims to engage the viewer's perception and create a sense of movement and depth on a flat surface.
- Op art and packaging design: The bold, eye-catching patterns of Op art have been used in packaging design to create visually striking products that stand out on shelves. The use of optical illusions can draw attention to the product and make it more memorable to consumers.

- Riley's work was featured in Vogue in 1965, highlighting her status as an internationally famous artist and the mainstream appeal of Op art during that time. The inclusion of her portrait in a fashion magazine like Vogue indicates the crossover between fine art and popular culture, and how Op art's visually engaging style resonated with a wide audience beyond just the art world.

## Neo-concretism in Brazil ✏️

</div>


<!-- 

Neoconcretist group to the Western (mainly European) art it was
addressing was one of deliberate rebuttal. The attack was made by
proxy: the official target of the Neoconcretos, as they made clear in
adopting this name, was a group to which they themselves had
initially helped to form, that of **the Concretos (or Concretistos),
but their real enemy was a particular brand of geometric abstract**
art they had once embraced but were now violently rejecting

The neo-concrete movement was a splinter group of the 1950s Brazilian concrete art movement, calling for a greater sensuality, colour and poetic feeling in concrete art. The neo-concretists were interested in the relationship between the artwork and the viewer, and they sought to create works that were more interactive and engaging. They believed that art should be a living experience, rather than a static object to be admired from a distance.

A rejecting the rationalism of concrete art, the neo-concretists embraced a more organic and intuitive approach to art-making. They were interested in exploring the emotional and psychological effects of art, and they sought to create works that would evoke a sense of wonder and delight in the viewer.

With the construction of the country’s new utopian capital, Brasilia and the formation of the São Paulo Biennial, young Brazilian artists were inspired to create art that drew on contemporary theories of cybernetics, gestalt psychology and the optical experiments of international artists like Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely.

Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, Am’lcar de Castro, Franz Weissmann, Reynaldo Jardim, Sergio de Camargo, Theon Spanudis and Ferreira Gullar were unhappy with the dogmatic approach of the concrete group, so published the neo-concrete manifesto in 1959. In 1960 Hélio Oiticica joined the group and his groundbreaking series of red and yellow painted hanging wood constructions effectively liberated colour into three-dimensional space.

### art institutions:
in 1947, the Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo (MASP) was founded, followed the next year by the Museo de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro (MAM-RJ), then, in 1949, by the Museo de Arte Moderna, Sao nPaulo (MAM-SP). An Alexander Calder exhibition put MAM-RJ on the map in 1948; a Max Bill retrospective did the same for MASP in 1950, followed in 1951 by the grand affair of the First Sao Paulo Bienal, organized by MAM-SP, at which Max Bill received the first prize for sculpture.
In the late forties and 


### brasilia capital:
  - Historians have described in great detail the peculiar sociopolitical atmosphere of Brazil after World War II and throughout the fifties, the general ambition to abolish all prewar remnants of colonial subjection, the pervasive sense of potentiality that led in 1956, for example, to the unprecedented competition for the design of the capital Brasilia
- The coup:
  - In 1964, a military coup d'état overthrew President João Goulart (pronounced: zhoo-OWN gular ), leading to a 21-year dictatorship marked by political repression, censorship, and human rights abuses. The regime cracked down on dissent, including artists and intellectuals, many of whom were arrested, tortured, or forced into exile.

In the late 1940s, Calder loomed large in the Brazilian art scene, with his work featured in major exhibitions at the newly established Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro (MAM-RJ) and the Museu de Arte de São Paulo (MASP). His influence was profound, inspiring a generation of Brazilian artists to explore new forms of abstraction and kinetic art. Calder's innovative use of movement and his ability to create dynamic sculptures that interacted with their environment resonated deeply with Brazilian artists, who were eager to break away from traditional artistic conventions and embrace modernism. The 1953–1954 retrospective of Calder's work at the Pavilhão dos Estados during the second Bienal de São Paulo further solidified his impact on the Brazilian art community, showcasing his groundbreaking contributions to the world of sculpture and kinetic art.

### Concretism

<div>

“nothing is more concrete, more real, than a line, a color, a plane.”

</div>

<div text-xs>

- Theo van Doesburg, 1930
</div>

<!-- 

This term was first introduced in 1930 by Dutch artist Theo van Doesburg, who said that “nothing is more concrete, more real, than a line, a color, a plane.” Concrete art finds meaning only in its own material form, and artworks (typically paintings and sculptures) incorporate lines, colors, and/or flat surfaces (planes) that do not represent anything. Similar to but distinct from abstraction, Concrete art does not depict visual symbols or ideas from the natural world.

Max Bill, a Swiss artist and designer who was educated at the Bauhaus, became a founder and leader of the Concrete art movement in the later 1930s.

Max Bill was a Swiss architect, artist, and designer who was a key figure in the Concrete Art movement. His work was characterized by its geometric abstraction and emphasis on clarity and order. Bill's influence on Brazilian artists was significant, as his approach to art and design resonated with their desire to break away from traditional forms and embrace modernism. The Ulmer Stool, created in the 1950s, exemplifies Bill's commitment to functional design and geometric simplicity. This modular piece can be used as a stool or as shelves when mounted on the wall, reflecting Bill's belief in the integration of art and everyday life. His work inspired Brazilian artists to explore new possibilities in abstraction and design, contributing to the development of the Neo-Concrete movement in Brazil.

Bill and Bauhaus: Max Bill was a student at the Bauhaus, the influential German art school that emphasized the integration of

#### First exhibition of concrete art in Brazil: 

The first exhibition of concrete art in Brazil was held in 1952 at the Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro (MAM-RJ). 

In 1953 the Brazilian government invited him to lecture in Rio and Sao Paulo, and in 1956, a few months before hosting the "First National Exhibition of Concrete Art," MAM-RJ dedicated an exhibition to the Ulm school, presented as the legitimate successor of the Bauhaus. The "First National Exhibition of Concrete Art" was a turning point—though nothing went according to plan. The word "national" in its title does not signify in the least an isolationist
desire to retreat from the international arena; on the contrary, it was signaling that a grand federation was being created, in which the concretos of both Sao Paulo and Rio, who until then had worked separately, would unite their forces. 


The participants were the same in the two venues of the show
(among the Paulistas were Geraldo de Barros [1923-98] and
Judith Lauand [born 1922]; among the Cariocas, as Rio's inhabitants are nicknamed, were Aluisio Carvao [1920-2001], **Lygia Clark** [1920-88], Lygia Pape [1927-2004] and **Hello Oiticica** [1937-
80 ] ). 

But instead of the great harmonious union that was
supposed to result from this exhibition, a major split occurred,
which planted the seed of the Neoconcretist movement. To put it
briefly, the Cariocas were appalled by the dogmatism of the
Paulistas, and, rebelling against the strict obedience to Bill's cate-
chism, they prophesized the doom of any art bound by such a
limited and limiting ideology. The definitive rupture came in June
1957, marked by a public joust among poets (Gullar, Reynaldo
Jardim [1926-2011], and Oliviera Bastos [1933-2006] responding
with a text titled "Concrete Poetry: An Intuitive Experience" to
one by de Campos called "From the Phenomenology of Composi-
tion to a Mathematics of Composition"), although the
Neoconcretist movement would not officially take off until March
1959, at the opening of the "First Exhibition of Neoconcrete Art"
in MAM-RJ, with the publication of the group's manifesto, writtenby Gullar but also signed by Amilcar de Castro (1920-2002),
Franz Weissmann (1911-2005), Clark, Pape, Jardim, and Theon
Spanudis (1915-86). (Oiticica and Willys de Castro [1926-88] would join the group very shortly thereafter.)

<!-- 

 Bicho (Critter), a sculpture by Lygia Clark, defies these ideas of sculpture as a static idealized form. The viewer can fold, turn, close, and open Bicho, exploring its multifaceted nature. Consisting of geometric shapes connected through hinges, Lygia Clark created a sculpture that was not only participatory, but also seemingly infinite in its variability.

 Clark, on the other hand, sought a freer and more organic interpretation of geometric abstraction, effectively eliminating the demarcation between two-dimensional and three-dimensional form.

<!-- 

We see the organic nature of Bicho, in keeping with the ideas of neoconcretism, not only in its exoskeletal form and transformative nature, but also in its name. Whereas traditional sculpture hides its structural support, Clark instead focuses on it, by drawing attention to the hinges that bind the work together, and to the empty spaces created in between these folded spaces. As seen in Bicho, the straight-edged and round shapes recall skeletal forms while the hinges function as spinal columns. Even the name, Critter, recalls natural life, as if the work were a living creature meant to be animated—or better yet mutated—by the participant.

Clark made these sculptures to be participatory, and therefore variable. Created as a series, there are around seventy Bichos in total. She challenged not only the idea that sculpture is fixed, but also that there is only one way to view or experience it. The sculptures are fundamentally unstable—both literally and metaphorically. They have no front or back, no inside or outside, no left or right. In this way, they have no author, since each participant creates a different experience of Bicho. Different from performance art however, these sculptures do not create spectacle, but rather invite participation. The work of art is not the viewing of the sculpture itself, but one’s participation with it.

** it was Ferreira Gullar, primary author of the “Neoconcrete Manifesto” who called Bicho neither painting nor sculpture. Instead, Gullar described the work as a non-object (an early phrase for abstraction) that did not have a function and that resisted categorization.**
