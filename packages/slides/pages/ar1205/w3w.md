<!-- 

1517: Luther posts his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, sparking the Protestant Reformation.
- Luther's emphasis on faith and scripture challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and its practices, such as the sale of indulgences.
- The Reformation led to significant religious, political, and cultural changes across Europe, including the rise of Protestant denominations and conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), between various European powers.

## Mannerism ✏️


<!-- 

"_maniera_" = artistic individuality, style (used by Vasari in his *Lives of the Artists*)

The classicist of the seventeenth century (Bellori and Malvasi) first to connect with the concept of the _maniera_ the idea of an affected, hackeneyed style, which is the opposite of naturalism.

estrangement fro classicism which makes itself felt in art after 1520

why does classicis, which in qntiquity was a style based on composure and permanence, now appear as a 'transitory stage'? -->

layout: quote
author: "Arnold Hauser, <i>The Social History of Art</i>, 1951"
---

... to understand the creative nature of this style and to recognize in the often imitation of classical models an overcompensation for the spiritual distance by which it was separated from them. ... We are the first to grasp the fact that the stylistic efforts of all leading artists of mannerism ... were concentered, above all, on breaking up the all too obvious regularity and harmony of classical art and replacing its superpersonal normativity by more subjectve and more suggestuve features.

<!-- 

#### El Greco
At the time he painted on Crete, Venice controlled the island. He left for Venice at age 26, where he worked in Titian’s workshop and was influenced by Tintoretto’s loose brushwork.
He then traveled to Rome before settling in Toledo, Spain in 1577 to work for the Spanish King Philip II. He lived there until his death in 1614.

#### subject

Don Gonzalo Ruíz, who died in 1323 (and was later known by the title, Count of Orgaz), is not likely someone you know. Ruíz, who was the Señor (Lord or ruler) of the town of Orgaz, donated money to the church of Santo Tomé in Toledo, Spain upon his death. Local stories circulated about the Count of Orgaz in the 14th century, including a miraculous story of the circumstances of his burial: that after he died Saints Augustine and Stephen lowered him into his tomb to honor him for his good deeds.

<!-- 

At the bottom center, Saint Augustine (on the viewer’s right) and Saint Stephen (on the viewer’s left) hold the Count of Orgaz, who is dressed in armor. As they lower him into his tomb, we get the impression that they place his body into the physical tomb that exists in front of the painting in the burial chapel.
