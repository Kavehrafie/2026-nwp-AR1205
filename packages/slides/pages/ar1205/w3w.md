<!-- 

Michelangelo’s Last Judgement, painted upon the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel, is a complicated and intentionally terrifying vision of the end of time. With disconcerting jumps in scale, nude figures in contorted poses are spread across a blue sky, their souls and bodies bared before God as they either rise in glory or are crushed in despair. Michelangelo’s figures are heavy, their musculature overemphasized—these are the bodies of the afterlife, rooted in the artist’s imagination and the brawny nudes of antiquity rather than reality. His maniera is unmistakable.

this painting was executed a decade after the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, during a period of significant religious and political turmoil in Europe.

- The Protestant Reformation, initiated by Martin Luther in 1517, challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and led to widespread religious conflict.
- The Sack of Rome in 1527 by the troops of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, marked a significant blow to the power and prestige of the Papacy.

- The moment of reformation and religious upheaval in Europe

- commissioned by Pope Clement VII (Giulio de’ Medici) in 1523
- designed to house the Medici family's collection of manuscripts and books
- Michelangelo designed both the architecture and the interior furnishings, including the famous staircase
- staircase: dramatic, flowing design that appears to spill into the vestibule, creating a sense of movement and energy
- architecture: combines elements of classical architecture with Michelangelo's unique style, characterized by bold forms and dynamic compositions
- the library's reading room features a series of large windows that provide ample natural light for reading and studying
- the library is considered one of Michelangelo's greatest architectural achievements and a masterpiece of Renaissance design
- Mannerism: style that emerged in the later years of the Renaissance, characterized by exaggerated proportions, complex compositions, and a departure from the balanced harmony of earlier Renaissance art

Flunting of rules of classical architecture; disregard for symmetry and proportion; dramatic, almost theatrical use of space and form; emphasis on complexity and tension over harmony and balance.

— Council of Trent, 1563 {.text-xs}


<!-- 

[click:4] ### Reformation
1517: Luther posts his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, sparking the Protestant Reformation.
- Luther's emphasis on faith and scripture challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and its practices, such as the sale of indulgences.
- The Reformation led to significant religious, political, and cultural changes across Europe, including the rise of Protestant denominations and conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), between various European powers.

[click:10] ### Counter-Reformation
The Catholic Church responded to the Reformation with the Counter-Reformation, which included the Council of Trent (1545-1563).
- The Council reaffirmed Catholic doctrines and reformed church practices, emphasizing the role of art in religious devotion.
- One of the final points made in the Tridentine decrees (which, you will recall, were vague on what art should look like specifically) has been interpreted as an attack on mannerist art (which is itself almost impossible for scholars to define today because it encompasses such a broad range of forms and artists). The decree states that
- The Baroque style, characterized by emotional intensity, dramatic use of light and shadow, and dynamic compositions, emerged as a means to inspire faith and convey religious themes effectively.

The ambiguity of mannerism and often sensuous treatment of figures proved problematic for some. The Reformation brought with it a new scrutiny of religious images. The Augustinian monk Martin Luther and other Protestant leaders were concerned that images could mislead or be treated as idols. While the Catholic Church never wavered in its commitment to the validity of images as tools for religious practice, the style of religious art did become an issue. At the Council of Trent (1545–1563), a series of meetings intended to solidify Catholic doctrine and strengthen the threatened church, it was declared that religious images must be clear, unambiguous, and lead viewers to faithful contemplation. Art should be for celebrating and instructing in the faith, not for showcasing artistic skill. The sensuosity, ambiguity, and conspicuous artistry of mannerism was not to be tolerated in sacred art. This call for conservatism in art on the part of the Catholic Counter Reformation, the movement behind the Council of Trent, did not bring an end to mannerist explorations. 

[click:11] ### The Peace of Augsburg (1555) was
a treaty in the Holy Roman Empire that ended religious conflict between Catholics and Lutherans by allowing princes to choose either Catholicism or Lutheranism as the official religion of their territory, under the principle "cuius regio, eius religio" (whose realm, his religion). It granted Lutheranism legal status, but excluded Calvinism and other groups, establishing a temporary religious division that lasted until the Peace of Westphalia.

## Mannerism ✏️


<!-- 

"_maniera_" = artistic individuality, style (used by Vasari in his *Lives of the Artists*) What we do find is “maniera,” a term rooted in the word mano (hand). 

Maniera was also used in the 16th century to suggest “stylishness” itself, a self-conscious, artificial artistry that at times privileged fantasy over reality.

estrangement from classicism which makes itself felt in art after 1520

It has been used to designate art that is overtly artificial, often ambiguous, and conspicuously sophisticated. However, these are by no means the only stylistic traits associated with this designation. Mannerist imagery frequently pushes the boundaries of fantasy and imagination with artists looking to art, rather than nature, as a model, as Parmigianino was clearly doing in his painting.

When the term was first widely used in the 17th century, it was intended as a pejorative label. It was used to negatively characterize Italian renaissance art created between 1520 and 1600 that was seen by these later audiences as overly stylized and tasteless, a debased departure from the classicism of Raphael and the high renaissance. 

The classicist of the seventeenth century (Bellori and Malvasi) first to connect with the concept of the _maniera_ the idea of an affected, hackeneyed style, which is the opposite of naturalism.

Today, the English term “mannerism” is used to broadly designate 16th-century art throughout Europe (and even in places like the Americas in the 16th and 17th centuries) that is conspicuously artificial, often emotionally provocative, and designed to impress.

why does classicis, which in qntiquity was a style based on composure and permanence, now appear as a 'transitory stage'? 

Parasitic. Original. Derogatory. Refined. Hyper-decorative. Courtly. Anti-classical. Classicizing.

<!-- 

One of the most influential artworks for mannerist artists was the Hellenistic (a period covering the 4th to 1st centuries BCE) sculpture of Laocoön and his sons, whose twisting, contorted bodies appealed to a variety of artists of this time, including the Burgundian artist Juan de Juni (who worked in Spain), Domenicos Theotokopoulos (known as El Greco), Alonso Berruguete, and Francesco Primaticcio. Berruguete frequently adapted aspects of the Laocoön in his sculpture to heighten the emotional expressiveness of his saintly figures, such as we find in his Abraham and Isaac.

it seems that he is wightless, almost floating, as his body is supported by the figures around him. One figure on his tiptoes reaches up to support Christ's arm, while another figure holds his legs.

<!-- 

Francesco Mazzola, also called Parmigianino, after Parma, his birth town, was an artist whose talent came to the fore from a very early age. He trained in direct contact with Correggio who, at the time, was painting the large cycles of frescoes in the churches of Parma. After completing his first commissions in Parma, Parmigianino finished his training in Rome, where he studied the works of Michelangelo and Raphael. His intellectual, eccentric temperament drove him to develop an elegant, sophisticated, anti-classic style that made him the leading figure of Emilian Mannerism.

Parmigianino’s Madonna of the Long Neck is a famous example of mannerist art. It was painted for the funerary chapel of an Italian noblewoman. In the center, the Virgin’s lower body seems to swell, her impossibly long legs swathed in billowing fabric that then clings sensuously to her rapidly tapering torso, revealing her navel and a protruding nipple. Her head, seeming too small for her body, is precariously balanced upon an elongated neck rising from narrow, sloping shoulders. Christ’s spindly, bare body stretches across her lap. Pressed closely to her right are sensuous yet bizarrely proportioned angels, compressed into the foreground. One angelic figure, showing a long bare leg, holds an elegant antique vase with the tips of his impossibly long fingers. On the right side, a diminutive figure in the lower corner mysteriously holds up a scroll, while the background recedes dramatically into a deep, unfinished space. The architectural space is designed to appear illogical (though it can be reconciled) and the within it figures are mis-proportioned, yet the overall impression is one of elegance and carefully contrived artifice. This effect is enhanced by the use of rich jewel tones and the absence of visible brush marks. 

- see witH PIETA
- art taken from art (self-referential)
- intense reaction against the harmonious proportions and balanced compositions of High Renaissance art and perfection. Almost game-like distortion of natural forms.

Powerful, elongated figures writhe across painted walls and ceiling that are reminiscent of ancient sarcophagi.

... to understand the creative nature of this style and to recognize in the often imitation of classical models an overcompensation for the spiritual distance by which it was separated from them. ... We are the first to grasp the fact that the stylistic efforts of all leading artists of mannerism ... were concentered, above all, on breaking up the all too obvious regularity and harmony of classical art and replacing its superpersonal normativity by more subjectve and more suggestuve features.

<!-- 
### Secular Mannerism

While mannerist qualities are found in secular works, like Bronzino’s Allegory with Venus and Cupid


### Stylishness
Mannerist art has been associated with the tastes of aristocratic patrons, particularly those within court circles where displays of wealth and appreciation for beautiful things helped cultivate an elite persona. The self-conscious artifice and deliberate complexity of these works would have appealed to patrons who were familiar with recent artistic developments and eager to show off their knowledge and good taste. The general rise in the status of the artist—particularly in central Italy where mannerism first developed over the course of the renaissance, may also have contributed to a rising taste in art that reflected an artist’s individual style.

#### El Greco
At the time he painted on Crete, Venice controlled the island. He left for Venice at age 26, where he worked in Titian’s workshop and was influenced by Tintoretto’s loose brushwork.
He then traveled to Rome before settling in Toledo, Spain in 1577 to work for the Spanish King Philip II. He lived there until his death in 1614.

#### subject

Don Gonzalo Ruíz, who died in 1323 (and was later known by the title, Count of Orgaz), is not likely someone you know. Ruíz, who was the Señor (Lord or ruler) of the town of Orgaz, donated money to the church of Santo Tomé in Toledo, Spain upon his death. Local stories circulated about the Count of Orgaz in the 14th century, including a miraculous story of the circumstances of his burial: that after he died Saints Augustine and Stephen lowered him into his tomb to honor him for his good deeds.

piero della francesca's resurrection (c. 1463-65) in sansepolcro 
The angularity of El Greco’s figures, particularly in the earthly scene at the bottom of the painting, may have been inspired by Piero della Francesca’s Resurrection fresco in Sansepolcro, Italy. The elongated proportions and sharp angles of El Greco’s figures contrast with the more naturalistic forms of Renaissance art, creating a sense of otherworldliness that aligns with the spiritual themes of the painting.
