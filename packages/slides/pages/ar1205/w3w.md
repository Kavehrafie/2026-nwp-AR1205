... to understand the creative nature of this style and to recognize in the often imitation of classical models an overcompensation for the spiritual distance by which it was separated from them. ... We are the first to grasp the fact that the stylistic efforts of all leading artists of mannerism ... were concentered, above all, on breaking up the all too obvious regularity and harmony of classical art and replacing its superpersonal normativity by more subjectve and more suggestuve features.

baroque vs. mannerism

"Mannerism is the artistic style of an aristocratic, essentially international cultured class, the early baroque the expression of a more popular, more emotional, more nationalistic trend. ... in the sixteenth century mannerism is the court style par excellence." (Hauser)

"The mannerism of the court is, especially in its later form. a uniform and universally European movement---the first great international style since the Gothic." (Hauser)
