<!--
Made for the prestige chapel of the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium.

Jan's brother Hubert began the altarpiece, and Jan completed it after Hubert's death in 1426.

### Interpretation
- **Subject**: A wedding, a betrothal, or a posthumous portrait
- **Historical Context**: Giovanni di Nicolao di Arnolfini (wealthy merchant from Lucca, Italy) and his wife Costanza Trenta, who lived in Bruges
- **Panofsky's Thesis**: Interpreted as a legal marriage contract (though recent scholarship questions this reading)
- **Patronage**: Arnolfini sold goods to the Burgundian court where Jan van Eyck was court painter

### Symbolism and Iconography
- **Signature**: "Johannes de eyck fuit hic 1434" (Jan van Eyck was here 1434) - artist as witness
- **Convex Mirror**: Reflects the room and two additional figures (possibly the artist and a witness)
- **Single Candle**: Burning in the chandelier may symbolize the sacredness of the event or the presence of God
- **Hand Position**: Joined hands may represent oath-taking or marital vows
- **Removed Shoes**: May indicate piety or the sacred nature of the space
- **St. Margaret**: Carving on the bedpost (patron saint of childbirth) suggests fertility
- **Passion of Christ**: Scenes depicted around the mirror frame
- **Oranges**: Rare luxury items symbolizing wealth and possibly fertility
- **Amber Prayer Beads**: Devotional objects indicating piety
- **Asian Carpet**: Expensive import demonstrating global trade connections

### Material Culture and Status

- **Woman's Attire**: Heavy woolen gown lined with fur (green color may symbolize fertility)
- **Social Position**: Celebration of merchant class wealth and status

### Technical Elements
- **Perspective**: Proportions are slightly off and perspective is inconsistent
- **Medium**: Oil on oak wood - showcases van Eyck's mastery of oil painting technique
- **Detail**: Extraordinary rendering of textures (fabric, metal, wood, glass)

<!-- 

### Jan van Eyck, _Man in a Red Turban_ (Self-Portrait), 1433

- **Gaze and Presence**: Direct, confrontational stare engages the viewer
- **Inscription**: "Als Ich Can" (As I can) - pun on his name and statement of artistic humility
- **Technical Mastery**: 
    - Oil on panel showcases unprecedented detail
    - Remarkable rendering of textures (fabric, skin, stubble)
    - Light reflection on eyes and headdress
- **Historical Significance**:
    - Often considered the earliest surviving panel self-portrait in Western art
    - Breaks from medieval tradition of anonymous artists
    - Establishes artist as individual creator and intellectual figure
- **Framing Device**: Stone frame with painted inscription creates illusion of window or mirror
- **Artistic Innovation**: Demonstrates Northern Renaissance attention to surface detail and optical realism

<!-- 
inwardness or subjectvity
"melancholy": condition where the self is turned inward upon itself, becomes absorned in, and parlyzed by, its own thoughts

Melancholia, being  one of humors, bile so to speak,  was believed to affect the mind and body. In particular, it was associated with intellectuals and artists, who were thought to be more prone to bouts of melancholy (creativity and melancholy were often linked in German Renaissance thought).

author: "Joseph Leo Koerner, _The Moment of Self-Portraiture in German Renaissance Art_, p.26"
color: navy
---

This creativity, more abstract and speculative than manual labor, elevates artists to a status akin to God's.... Where the Middle Ages substantialized inwardness as the excess of black bile and moralized that excess as the deadly sin of acedia, the Renaissance abstracted inwardness as an inherent quality of creative genius and valorized its effects in the originality of the artist, whose works are wholly his own.

- the unusual viewpoint, as if he put his chin on the ground to look closely at the plants 
- multiplicity and variations of plants depicted (various species of grasses, flowers, and weeds)

It is a woodcut (first and most popular) print created as part of a series illustrating the Book of Revelation from the Bible.

- The print is known for its dramatic composition, intricate details, and powerful symbolism.
- Dürer's mastery of the woodcut technique is evident in the dynamic lines and textures that convey movement and emotion.
- The print reflects the apocalyptic anxieties of the late 15th century, a time marked by social upheaval, religious turmoil, and fears of the end times.

1517: Luther posts his Ninety-five Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, sparking the Protestant Reformation.
- Luther's emphasis on faith and scripture challenged the authority of the Catholic Church and its practices, such as the sale of indulgences.
- The Reformation led to significant religious, political, and cultural changes across Europe, including the rise of Protestant denominations and conflicts such as the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), between various European powers.
