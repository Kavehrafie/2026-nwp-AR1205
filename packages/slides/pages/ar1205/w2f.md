<!--
The drawing, which visualizes an idea of human proportions from an ancient Roman architectural text by Vitruvius, measures slightly smaller than a sheet of printer paper at 343 x 245 mm (approximately 13 1/2 x 9 3/4 inches). Yet the “Vitruvian Man” creates a large visual impact through its clear and restrained composition. Three elements form the image: a single male figure, one circle, and one square. The man stands facing frontally while his hands and feet rest on the edges of both the circle and square. Vitruvius wrote in Book 3 of De architectura that a circle and a square could be drawn centered from the navel of an outstretched human figure. 

Cheek crags and deep eye sockets give the figure’s head a three-dimensionality at odds with the outlined body. Clarity is privileged over aesthetics as with a scientific illustration in an anatomical text.

Leonardo’s effort to visualize Vitruvius’ written description of ideal proportions can be understood as part of a general cultural interest in the idea of “perfect” proportions that Italian Renaissance culture had absorbed from classical thought. 

**Drawing**: Drawings were also made for workshop use. Studio assistants and apprentices in artistic workshops used study drawings as guides for creating drapery, gestures, anatomy, and even animals. Workshops also prepared full-scale transfer drawings for large projects instead of drawing compositional outlines freehand. 

Reading Vitruvius’ De architectura as well as Plato’s Timaeus acquainted Leonardo with the common classical idea that architectural and human proportions could be analogous. In Book 3 of De architectura, Vitruvius compared the symmetry and harmony of a temple’s architecture to the human body. As a beautiful building is made up of parts relating to each other in a system of predictable mathematical ratios, so too, Vitruvius theorized, could the human body be understood as proportional parts.

**Body and Building**: The Renaissance interest in the relationship between the human body and architecture can be seen in other works of art as well. For example, the caryatids of the Erechtheion on the Athenian Acropolis (c. 421–407 BCE) are sculpted female figures that serve as architectural supports for the building’s porch roof. The sculpted figures function both as representations of the human form and as structural elements of the building, embodying the Renaissance fascination with the harmony between human anatomy and architectural design.

</StickyNote>

<!--
The subject is presented in three-quarter view, wearing a dark, sumptuous garment that signifies his status. His attire includes a fur-lined robe and a black hat, hinting at the fashion of the period. The white collar of his shirt delicately emerges from the robe, offering a stark contrast to the dark clothing and imbuing the composition with a touch of elegance.

One can observe the remarkable attention to detail in the rendering of textures, from the soft fur to the folds of the fabric. The background is understated, which directs the viewer’s focus to the subject’s face and expression. The subject’s gaze projects warmth and intelligence, features befitting his reputation as a courtier and the author of “The Book of the Courtier.”

- the ideal personality which Castiglione represents as throughly unattainable
- versatility, the uniform development of physical and spiritual capacities, skilled in the use of weapons and in rhetoric, athlete, musician, poet, and painter: the aristocratic aversion from every kind of specialization (see Hauser)
- presetving one's composure and dignity in all circumstances
- colors disappear; moving to more monochromatic schemes



**Raphael did such things with apparent ease. He embodied the ideal of sprezzatura (the appearance of nonchalant effortlessness in his creative process), a notion popularized by Raphael’s good friend, Baldassare Castiglione, in his Book of the Courtier (1528).**

Raffaello Sanzio, better known simply as Raphael, enjoyed a meteoric career.

Died at age 37 in 1520, having produced an astonishing body of work that included altarpieces, portraits, and frescoes.

layout: quote
author: Arnold Hauser, <i>The Social History of Art</i>
quotesize: text-2xl
color: navy
---

The art of High Renaissance is absolutely secular in its outlook; even in the representation of religious subjects, it attains its ideal style not by contrasting natural with supernatural reality, but by creating a distance between the objects of natural reality itself---a distance which in the world of visual experience creates differences of value similar to those that exist between the elite and the masses in human society. Its harmony is the utopian ideal of a world from which all conflict is excluded, and moreover, not as a result of the rule of a democratic but of an autocratic principle.

<!-- 
Hauser is an example of a Social Art Historian, who interprets art within its broader social, political, and economic contexts.

The model struggles when applied to other major centers like Venice (where art was driven by a mercantile republic, not papal patronage) or the slower-developing Renaissance in Northern Europe.

Over-privileges sociology, downplaying artistic lineage, individual genius, and intellectual movements like Neo-Platonism.

<!-- 

- grotesque heads: exaggerated facial features to express character, emotion, or humor
- Leonardo believed that the outer face revealed the inner soul. He wasn't just drawing "ugly" people; he was cataloguing human character and emotion. He wrote in his notebooks that one should observe in crowds "the faces of men and women... and the bizarre things they do." Each grotesque face tells a story of a life lived—of folly, cunning, rage, or absurdity. They are psychological studies as much as physical ones.
- a taxonomy of human features: catalogue of human particularity and vice.
- on one hand, there is a drive toward empirical, scientific taxonomy (observation, classification), and on the other, a persistent moral/classical association of physical features with inner character.

<!--
## Michelangelo's *David* (1501–1504)

### Historical Context

**Commission and Location**
- Commissioned for the **outside of Florence Cathedral** (Santa Maria del Fiore)
- Intended to be placed **40 feet above street level** — explaining its monumental scale (17 feet tall)
- Michelangelo was only **26 years old** when he received this commission
- Commission followed his enormous success with the *Pietà* in Rome
- Carved from an **abandoned block of marble** that had lain unused for decades

**Political Background**
- Florence had recently **expelled the Medici family** (1494)
- Republic was reestablished under the influence of **Savonarola**, a charismatic monk
- Savonarola created a **theocratic state**, famously burning "vanities" — manuscripts, paintings, and secular art
- Savonarola was eventually **excommunicated, arrested, executed, and burned**
- Florence saw itself as having defeated **two tyrants**: the Medici and Savonarola
- The government looked back to the **golden age of the Florentine Republic** (100 years prior) for inspiration

### The David Symbol

**Biblical Story**
- David was a young shepherd when the Philistines attacked Israel
- No Israelite warrior would face the giant **Goliath**
- David volunteered, took off his armor, and used a sling with a single stone
- He struck Goliath between the eyes, felled him, and cut off his head with the giant's own sword
- Story of **good overcoming evil through God's favor**

**Florentine Identification**
- Florentines saw themselves as **underdogs like David**
- They believed they had defeated enemies through **God's favor**
- David became a **potent political symbol** of the Republic
- Earlier Davids by **Donatello and Verrocchio** also embodied these ideals
- Donatello's *David* had been commissioned by the Medici — when they were expelled, the government **appropriated it** as a symbol of the Republic

### Artistic Innovation

**Classical Influence**
- Part of the **rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman culture** under Medici patronage
- Artists sought to **compete with ancient models**
- The **contrapposto stance** (weight on right leg) comes directly from classical antiquity
- Florence saw itself as the **inheritor of Roman humanist traditions**

**A Revolutionary Choice of Moment**
- Earlier Davids show the **moment of victory** — after the fight
- They appear **youthful, confident, contemplative, introspective**
- Michelangelo chooses the **moment before the battle**
- David looks across space, **readying himself for the fight ahead**
- This is a **"pregnant moment"** — immediate anticipation of action

**Physical and Psychological Tension**
- Hips forward, shoulders forward, but head turned at **three-quarters**
- Eyes turned even further than the head — just caught first glance of enemy
- The pose itself (contrapposto) is **relaxed**
- Body seems to have been at rest, now being **filled with tension** for battle
- Face conveys **uncertainty about the future**
- We sense him as a **human being facing his enemy**, not displaying confidence in God
- This makes the sculpture **reassuring** — we know David will triumph, Florence will defeat its enemies

### Transformation of Meaning

**From Religious to Political**
- Originally commissioned for a **religious context** (cathedral exterior)
- Too fabulous to place high up on the cathedral
- Instead placed on a platform in front of the **seat of government** (Piazza della Signoria)
- Taken from religious context and placed in **political context**
- Became a **symbol of the newly reconstituted Republic**
- Medici supporters threw stones at it — recognizing its **political potency**

**From Political to Artistic**
- Now in the **Accademia Gallery** — a museum context
- Transformed again into a **work of art** in our secular museum culture
- Understood as expression of **history, aesthetic appreciation, and Michelangelo's mastery**
- Michelangelo earned the nickname **"Il Divino"** (the Divine One) for this almost superhuman achievement

### Key Takeaways

1. **Scale and location** were determined by original architectural context
2. **Political symbolism** was central to the sculpture's meaning for Florentines
3. **Choice of moment** (anticipation rather than victory) creates psychological tension
4. **Classical influence** appears in contrapposto stance and humanist ideals
5. **Meaning transformed** from religious → political → artistic over time
6. **Michelangelo's mastery** earned him divine status in the eyes of contemporaries

<!-- 


In 1504, at the age of twenty-one, Raphael arrived in Florence. There, the young artist found a flourishing art market. He was able to gaze upon the powerfully expressive works of the early Florentine renaissance, and also encountered first-hand the work of local artists, including that of Leonardo da Vinci, whose influence is evident in several of Raphael’s Florentine paintings. 


In Florence, Raphael’s commissions were primarily for smaller, private paintings, such as the Madonna of the Meadow (1505) or his dual portraits of Agnolo and Maddalena Doni (1506). Local commissions for large-scale altarpieces—more desirable projects both for the higher prices they commanded and the public exposure they brought—eluded Raphael during these years. He did, however, continue to fulfil more prestigious projects for patrons outside of Florence, including in Siena, Urbino, and Perugia

<!--
Having never completed a large-scale project in Florence, Raphael left for Rome in 1508. He was drawn to the Eternal City by the powerful Warrior Pope, Julius II, who was in the process of re-vitalizing Rome. Julius was an astute patron. He recognized t- considered one of the greatest achievements in Western arthe potential of art and architecture to give material form to his vision for Rome as a new center of the Christian empire—one that would rival antiquity.

Raphael was initially one of a number of artists hired by Julius to decorate his personal suite of rooms in the Vatican palace, a semi-public space where the pope’s interests were to be materialized in art. The first room he painted, the **Stanza della Segnatura** (Stanza means “room” in Italian), so perfectly aligned with Julius’s vision that the entire suite was given over to him. The two frescos known as the School of Athens and Disputà (1509–1510) on the opposing largest walls of the Stanza represent Philosophy and Theology respectively. Raphael infused non-narrative scenes with dramatic force. His figures engage in active dialogue and interact emotionally—no artist before him had presented immaterial concepts with such ingenuity.

- Philosophy (School of Athens)
- Theology (Disputà)
- Poetry (Parnassus)

<!-- 

The School of Athens represents the gathering of the greatest philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians from classical antiquity. Central to the composition are Plato and Aristotle, who are surrounded by other luminaries such as Socrates, Pythagoras, Euclid, and Ptolemy. Raphael ingeniously included contemporary figures among the ancient philosophers: Leonardo da Vinci is depicted as Plato, Michelangelo as Heraclitus, and Raphael himself appears as Apelles.
