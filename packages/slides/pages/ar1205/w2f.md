![Leonardo da Vinci, “Vitruvian Man,” c. 1490, pen and watercolor over metalpoint on paper, 34.4 x 24.5 cm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg)


<!-- 

The drawing, which visualizes an idea of human proportions from an ancient Roman architectural text by Vitruvius, measures slightly smaller than a sheet of printer paper at 343 x 245 mm (approximately 13 1/2 x 9 3/4 inches). Yet the “Vitruvian Man” creates a large visual impact through its clear and restrained composition. Three elements form the image: a single male figure, one circle, and one square. The man stands facing frontally while his hands and feet rest on the edges of both the circle and square. Vitruvius wrote in Book 3 of De architectura that a circle and a square could be drawn centered from the navel of an outstretched human figure. 

Cheek crags and deep eye sockets give the figure’s head a three-dimensionality at odds with the outlined body. Clarity is privileged over aesthetics as with a scientific illustration in an anatomical text.

<!-- 

- the ideal personality which Castiglione represents as throughly unattainable
- versatility, the uniform development of physical and spiritual capacities, skilled in the use of weapons and in rhetoric, athlete, musician, poet, and painter: the aristocratic aversion from every kind of specialization (see Hauser)
- presetving one's composure and dignity in all circumstances
- colors disappear; moving to more monochromatic schemes
