- the ideal personality which Castiglione represents as throughly unattainable
- versatility, the uniform development of physical and spiritual capacities, skilled in the use of weapons and in rhetoric, athlete, musician, poet, and painter: the aristocratic aversion from every kind of specialization (see Hauser)
