baroque vs. mannerism

"Mannerism is the artistic style of an aristocratic, essentially international cultured class, the early baroque the expression of a more popular, more emotional, more nationalistic trend. ... in the sixteenth century mannerism is the court style par excellence." (Hauser)

"The mannerism of the court is, especially in its later form. a uniform and universally European movement---the first great international style since the Gothic." (Hauser)

## Baroque ✏️

<!-- 

The origins of the term are not entirely clear, but the most accepted (and evocative) theory is that it originated from a term (barrôco in Portuguese, barrueca in Spanish) describing a specific type of irregular pearl: in other words, a natural but artificial-looking, precious but misshapen object.

As you probably guessed, when applied to art, the word “Baroque” can connote a certain measure of distortion and imperfection. 

in the second half of the 18th century, when it started to refer to art of the previous century, the term “Baroque” designated art which was “not in accord with the rules of proportions.” [2] In the 19th century, it was associated with notions of bizarreness, and then finally became associated with a distorted and degenerate version of Renaissance (or more precisely of Italian Renaissance) art.

including the Counter-Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the consolidation of absolutism, the rise of capitalism, the expansion of colonization. In the 17th and 18th centuries, globalization meant connectedness across distant geographies, but not that every part of the globe was connected to each other. Rather, there were specific pathways shaped by the contours of religion, colonization, and trade, which themselves were closely linked. For example, the establishment of Portuguese colonies in India since the early 16th century facilitated the presence of religious missionaries such as the Jesuits, who in turn employed Hindu carvers to build extraordinary churches such as São Paulo in Diu, India. 

- by contrasty to Renaissance separating art forms, Baroque joined them to form a single, unifed experience

- Baroque also encompasses the hushed despair of Caravaggio's Flagellation of Christ, a threnody (pronounce: THREN-uh-dee, meaning: a song of lamentation for the dead) over the tortured body of Christ, emerging twisted and broken from the blackness, or _Saint Margaret_ by the Spanish master Francisco de Zurbarán, in which a poised virgin martyr gazes resolutely at the viewer despite having being burnt, boiled, beheaded and swallowed by a dragon.

- Baroque appealed to many different audiences, whether urban mobs in large public squares or solitary pilgrams mediating in a lonely wayside chapel.

### the intellectual baroque

Some works were aimed at intellectuals, such as the mythological frescos that adorned the ballrooms of the aristocracy: painted for Cardinal Odoardo Farnese

Annibale Carracci's ceiling fresco is based on an interpretation of Ovid's Metamorphoses (a Latin narrative poem that was a major source of mythological themes for Renaissance and Baroque artists) by the Farnese family librarian Fulvio Orsini, its classical theme also complemented the family's collection of antique sculpture and championed their wealth and erudition. 


The fresco depicts various love stories of the gods, including the tale of Jupiter and Europa, which is prominently featured in the central panel. The composition is dynamic and filled with movement, with figures swirling around in a complex arrangement that draws the viewer's eye across the entire ceiling. The use of foreshortening and dramatic poses enhances the sense of depth and three-dimensionality, creating an immersive experience for viewers looking up at the ceiling.

"Considered the greatest fresco since Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, Annibale's massive works traps its complex subject in an intricate web of feifned architecture, combining Michelangelo's _quadratura_ (illusionistic architecture) with a conceit called _quadro riportato_ (false frames painteind around frescoed images to make them look like easel paintings). The result is a three-dimentional overlapping of frames, false stuccos, flesh-coloured nudes and bronze medallions that nevertheless preserves the fresco's unity as it builds uptowards the central panel of _Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne_." (Bailey, 18)

### the popular baroque
- "the polychrome wooden crucifixion carved by Francesco Brunelli for the sacristy of the Gesu in Roome belongs to a tradition of hyper-realistic sculpture more common in Spain and Latin America, and is meant to provoke and shock the viewer. Even today the contrast between the suppleness of the flesh and the tortured pose and bloodied wounds in this dying Christ induces a visceral sense of pathos and sorrow." (Bailey, 18)

Consider the ordinary figures, stark realism, and dramatic tenebrism of Diego Velázquez’s The Waterseller of Seville or Jusepe de Ribera’s Allegory of Taste—prime examples of what is sometimes referred to as “Baroque realism” alongside the “Baroque classicism” of Nicolas Poussin’s Et in Arcadia Ego, an image set in ancient Greece with quasi-archaeological accuracy.

<!-- 

Juan Sánchez Cotán’s Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber combines the hyper-realistic depiction of fruits and vegetables with the theatricality of staging these objects under dramatic lighting against a dark background, as well as an erudite classical reference: like most Baroque still life painters, Cotán was probably emulating the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis, who was known through written accounts for the deceptively illusionistic powers of his paintings.

<!-- 

A comparison between Raphael’s Madonna of the Goldfinch from the Renaissance and Peter Paul Rubens’s The Assumption of the Virgin from the Baroque illustrates Wölfflin’s categories. Raphael’s painting emphasizes defining lines, self-contained figures—notice how through her gaze and posture, the Virgin draws the composition inward rather than expanding it beyond the borders of the canvas—and spatial clarity. Rubens’s Assumption, on the other hand, displays painterly brushwork, prominent color, the blurring of contours, dynamic diagonals, and dramatic contrast of light and shadow. It also seems to project outward into the space of the viewer.

<!-- 


For example, consider how Miguel González and/or Juan González’s The Assumption of the Virgin, one of the many Latin American works related to prints after the painting by Rubens of the same subject, transforms the European model into something distinct and unexpected through the use of mother-of-pearl inlay enconchado, an artistic technique which reflects both a longstanding tradition of Indigenous peoples in Mexico and Japanese namban lacquer work, and that through its shimmering effect emphasizes the divinity of the subject.

In case you are wondering, knowledge of Japanese traditions such as lacquerware in Mexico was possible through the effect of global trade. Although wide geographical networks had existed before, what made the Baroque truly globe-encompassing was not only the inclusion of new continents such as the Americas to the mix, but also the establishment of trade routes and chartered companies in which imperial powers systematically promoted and monopolized the exchange of goods.

Trade routes and cultural exchange in the Baroque period

<!-- 

hese included:

the India Run (the voyage made by the Portuguese between Lisbon and Goa, on the southwestern coast of India. from the 16th to the 19th centuries)
the Manila Galleon (maintained by Spain between 1565–1815 to bring Asian goods—including the Japanese lacquer works that Mexican artists embraced in enconchado paintings such as the one mentioned above—across the North Pacific from Manila in the Philippines to Acapulco in New Spain, now Mexico),
and the Dutch East and West India Companies (VOC and GWC), which monopolized trade with Eurasia and Southern Africa and with West Africa and the Americas, respectively, during much of the 17th and 18th centuries.
These routes and companies moved exotic luxury objects such as Indian and Chinese fabrics, lacquer furniture, ivory figurines, porcelain, and spices across all the known continents. But most were also involved in the slave trade, adding a brutal aspect to this early modern globalization in the thousands of Africans who were forced into slavery in Europe and the Americas.

### painting
The wealth of materials, techniques, and especially the countless artists, artisans, and craftsmen of various origins who contributed to the creation of this global Baroque can’t be overestimated. Think about how the desire for Chinese porcelain in the Dutch Republic drove the production of delftware (illustrated earlier), a domestic version of the coveted ware (and in turn how the Chinese created new types of ceramics for European markets), or how the “perfect red” attained with American cochineal dye became the color of royalty and nobility across Europe and the Americas.

title: Oppression and Global Baroque
level: 3

<!-- 

To twist the metaphor of the baroque pearl even further, we should add that the wonder, exuberance, and opulence that characterizes so many examples of the global Baroque often originated from violence, force, and coercion. Paradoxically, this violent global world witnessed artists of African descent, such as the painters Juan de Pareja and Juan Correa and the architect Antonio Francisco Lisboa (known as Aleijadinho), thriving as professional artists in Spain, Mexico, and Brazil, respectively.

We can’t deny that one strand of the global Baroque is its Catholic, monarchical, and colonizing nature

</div>

- Galileo Galilei's telescopic observations of the moon in 1609 revealed a rugged, mountainous surface, challenging the Aristotelian notion of celestial perfection. His detailed drawings, published in the Sidereus Nuncius (1610), depicted the moon's craters and valleys, demonstrating that it was not a smooth, flawless sphere but a world with its own topography. This empirical observation undermined the long-held belief in the incorruptibility and perfection of heavenly bodies, suggesting that they were subject to change and imperfection just like earthly objects.

TODO identify the places

Bernini, from 1629 architect to the fabric of St Peter's, was charged with systematizing the display of three Early Christian relics housed from 1606 in niches in the crossing piers flanking the apse: the head of the apostle Andrew; the lance of Longinus; and Veronica's veil. These relics, along with fragments of the True Cross brought to Rome by St Helena and transferred to St Peter's in 1629 by Urban VIII, were assembled by Bernini in the crossing. Each relic was honoured by the decoration of one of the giant piers. Bernini divided each pier into an upper and lower section. In the latter he created a large niche for a colossal marble statue of the saint, while the relic itself was commemorated in a tabernacle framed by a pair of spiral marble columns from the original Constantinian basilica, thus stressing the continuity of place.

The statues, some three times life-size, were designed by Bernini and carved by him and by sculptors working under his control: St Andrew by François Duquesnoy; St Longinus by Bernini; St Helena by Andrea Bolgi; and St Veronica by Francesco Mochi. In pairs and as a group they relate to the baldacchino. St Veronica and St Helena seem to direct their attention to and move towards the papal altar at which Christ's Passion is re-enacted during Mass. St Andrew and St Longinus, with arms outspread in wonder, look upward towards the top of the baldacchino. Bernini thus charged the space of the crossing with an unprecedented dramatic power, engaging spectators physically and psychologically and making them not merely witnesses but participants in the unfolding events.

The photo shows the crossing with St Veronica (left pier) and St Helena (right pier). The baldacchino is in the centre.

- carved of four massive blocks of marble, each weighing several tons, and assembled on site. This monumental scale enhances the statue's dramatic impact, making it a focal point within the vast space of St. Peter's Basilica.
- Saint Longinus, the Roman centurion who pierced Christ's side with a lance, is depicted at the moment of his conversion, inspired by the sight of Christ's suffering. Bernini captures this transformative moment with dynamic movement and emotional intensity. Longinus is shown in a dramatic pose, his body twisting as he looks upward, his expression a mix of awe and revelation. The statue's swirling drapery and the upward gaze create a sense of ascension and spiritual awakening.
- he is caught in the mid-motion like snapshot and the moment of transfomation (physical and spiritual) is frozen in time
