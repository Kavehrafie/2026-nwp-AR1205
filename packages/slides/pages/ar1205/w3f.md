baroque vs. mannerism

"Mannerism is the artistic style of an aristocratic, essentially international cultured class, the early baroque the expression of a more popular, more emotional, more nationalistic trend. ... in the sixteenth century mannerism is the court style par excellence." (Hauser)

"The mannerism of the court is, especially in its later form. a uniform and universally European movement---the first great international style since the Gothic." (Hauser)

## Baroque ✏️

<!-- 

The origins of the term are not entirely clear, but the most accepted (and evocative) theory is that it originated from a term (barrôco in Portuguese, barrueca in Spanish) describing a specific type of irregular pearl: in other words, a natural but artificial-looking, precious but misshapen object.

As you probably guessed, when applied to art, the word “Baroque” can connote a certain measure of distortion and imperfection. 

in the second half of the 18th century, when it started to refer to art of the previous century, the term “Baroque” designated art which was “not in accord with the rules of proportions.” [2] In the 19th century, it was associated with notions of bizarreness, and then finally became associated with a distorted and degenerate version of Renaissance (or more precisely of Italian Renaissance) art.

including the Counter-Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the consolidation of absolutism, the rise of capitalism, the expansion of colonization. In the 17th and 18th centuries, globalization meant connectedness across distant geographies, but not that every part of the globe was connected to each other. Rather, there were specific pathways shaped by the contours of religion, colonization, and trade, which themselves were closely linked. For example, the establishment of Portuguese colonies in India since the early 16th century facilitated the presence of religious missionaries such as the Jesuits, who in turn employed Hindu carvers to build extraordinary churches such as São Paulo in Diu, India. 

- by contrasty to Renaissance separating art forms, Baroque joined them to form a single, unifed experience

<!-- 
### the intellectual baroque

Some works were aimed at intellectuals, such as the mythological frescos that adorned the ballrooms of the aristocracy: painted for Cardinal Odoardo Farnese

Annibale Carracci's ceiling fresco is based on an interpretation of Ovid's Metamorphoses (a Latin narrative poem that was a major source of mythological themes for Renaissance and Baroque artists) by the Farnese family librarian Fulvio Orsini, its classical theme also complemented the family's collection of antique sculpture and championed their wealth and erudition. 


The fresco depicts various love stories of the gods, including the tale of Jupiter and Europa, which is prominently featured in the central panel. The composition is dynamic and filled with movement, with figures swirling around in a complex arrangement that draws the viewer's eye across the entire ceiling. The use of foreshortening and dramatic poses enhances the sense of depth and three-dimensionality, creating an immersive experience for viewers looking up at the ceiling.

"Considered the greatest fresco since Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel, Annibale's massive works traps its complex subject in an intricate web of feifned architecture, combining Michelangelo's _quadratura_ (illusionistic architecture) with a conceit called _quadro riportato_ (false frames painteind around frescoed images to make them look like easel paintings). The result is a three-dimentional overlapping of frames, false stuccos, flesh-coloured nudes and bronze medallions that nevertheless preserves the fresco's unity as it builds uptowards the central panel of _Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne_." (Bailey, 18)

### the popular baroque
- "the polychrome wooden crucifixion carved by Francesco Brunelli for the sacristy of the Gesu in Roome belongs to a tradition of hyper-realistic sculpture more common in Spain and Latin America, and is meant to provoke and shock the viewer. Even today the contrast between the suppleness of the flesh and the tortured pose and bloodied wounds in this dying Christ induces a visceral sense of pathos and sorrow." (Bailey, 18)

<!-- 

A comparison between Raphael’s Madonna of the Goldfinch from the Renaissance and Peter Paul Rubens’s The Assumption of the Virgin from the Baroque illustrates Wölfflin’s categories. Raphael’s painting emphasizes defining lines, self-contained figures—notice how through her gaze and posture, the Virgin draws the composition inward rather than expanding it beyond the borders of the canvas—and spatial clarity. Rubens’s Assumption, on the other hand, displays painterly brushwork, prominent color, the blurring of contours, dynamic diagonals, and dramatic contrast of light and shadow. It also seems to project outward into the space of the viewer.

- Colombus's voyages to the Americas in 1492 marked the beginning of European exploration and colonization of the New World. This period saw the establishment of Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Dutch colonies across the Americas, leading to significant cultural exchanges, economic exploitation, and profound impacts on indigenous populations.
- The early colonial period was marked by significant encounters between European explorers and indigenous civilizations in the Americas. One of the most notable events was the meeting between Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, and Montezuma II, the emperor of the Aztec Empire, in 1519. This encounter symbolized the beginning of Spanish colonization in Mexico and had profound consequences for the indigenous peoples.

<!-- 


For example, consider how Miguel González and/or Juan González’s The Assumption of the Virgin, one of the many Latin American works related to prints after the painting by Rubens of the same subject, transforms the European model into something distinct and unexpected through the use of mother-of-pearl inlay enconchado, an artistic technique which reflects both a longstanding tradition of Indigenous peoples in Mexico and Japanese namban lacquer work, and that through its shimmering effect emphasizes the divinity of the subject.

In case you are wondering, knowledge of Japanese traditions such as lacquerware in Mexico was possible through the effect of global trade. Although wide geographical networks had existed before, what made the Baroque truly globe-encompassing was not only the inclusion of new continents such as the Americas to the mix, but also the establishment of trade routes and chartered companies in which imperial powers systematically promoted and monopolized the exchange of goods.

## about caravaggio

One of the most influential figures of the Baroque period was the Italian painter Caravaggio (1571–1610). His biography is as dramatic as his paintings: known for his fiery temper and tumultuous life, Caravaggio was involved in several violent incidents, including a murder that forced him to flee Rome. Despite his relatively short life, Caravaggio's impact on the art world was profound, and his innovative techniques and dramatic compositions left a lasting legacy.

After his untimely death in 1610, many Italian and non-Italian artists alike came to be considered his “followers,” even though they had never met the artist or worked alongside him. Unlike the typical Renaissance master-follower relationship, these artists could claim no direct descent from the studio of Caravaggio (since he did not have one), and in some cases, they had not even seen his paintings first-hand. Some artists imitated Caravaggio for only a brief phase of their careers – Baglione, Carlo Saraceni, and Guercino, for example—while others remained committed to Caravaggio’s stylistic model for the duration of their lives.

Nevertheless, these painters, often labeled Caravaggisti, emulated aspects of Caravaggio’s style, technique, and choice of subjects and were responsible for the dissemination of Caravaggism across the European continent.

Caravaggio seeking Pope's pardon: In 1606, after killing a man in a brawl, Caravaggio fled Rome and sought refuge in Naples, Malta, and Sicily. During this period, he hoped to obtain a papal pardon that would allow him to return to Rome. He painted several works during his exile, including "David with the Head of Goliath," which is believed to contain a self-portrait of the artist as Goliath's severed head. This painting is often interpreted as a reflection of Caravaggio's own struggles and desire for redemption.

#### David with the Head of Goliath

- painted around 1605, during Caravaggio's mature period, when he was at the height of his powers as an artist. The painting depicts the biblical story of David and Goliath, with David holding the severed head of the giant Goliath after defeating him in battle. 
- the choice of subject matter reflects Caravaggio's interest in dramatic and emotionally charged narratives, as well as his ability to capture the intensity of human experience.
- Caravaggio's use of chiaroscuro (the contrast between light and dark) is particularly striking in this painting. The figures are illuminated by a strong light source, which creates deep shadows and highlights the textures of the skin, hair, and clothing. This technique adds a sense of dramatic tension to the scene, emphasizing the violence and brutality of the moment.
- The composition of the painting is also noteworthy. David is depicted in a dynamic pose, with his body twisted and his gaze directed towards the viewer. The severed head of Goliath is rendered with a high level of realism, with details such as the blood dripping from the neck and the expression of shock on Goliath's face adding to the overall impact of the image.
- the portrayal of David is unconventional, as he is depicted as a youthful and somewhat vulnerable figure, rather than the heroic and triumphant figure often seen in traditional depictions of the story. This adds a layer of complexity to the painting, as it suggests that David's victory over Goliath was not without its costs.
- the goliath's head is widely believed to be a self-portrait of Caravaggio himself, adding a personal and introspective dimension to the work. This interpretation suggests that Caravaggio may have been grappling with his own inner demons and struggles, using the biblical story as a metaphor for his own life.
- why self-portrait? Caravaggio was a controversial figure, known for his tumultuous personal life and brushes with the law. By depicting himself as Goliath, Caravaggio may have been acknowledging his own flaws and vulnerabilities, while also asserting his artistic prowess and ability to conquer his own challenges through his work.

#### chiaroscuro
Chiaroscuro is an Italian term that translates to "light-dark" and refers to the artistic technique of using strong contrasts between light and dark to create a sense of volume and three-dimensionality in a two-dimensional artwork. This technique is often used to create dramatic effects, enhance the emotional impact of a scene, and guide the viewer's attention to specific areas of the composition.

<!-- 

### Concert of Youths
Caravaggio's Concert of Youths (c. 1595) is a prime example of his innovative approach to composition and use of light. The painting depicts a group of young musicians engaged in a lively performance, with a strong emphasis on realism and naturalism. Caravaggio's mastery of chiaroscuro (the contrast between light and dark) is evident in the way he illuminates the figures against a dark background, creating a dramatic and intimate atmosphere. The composition is dynamic, with the figures arranged in a way that suggests movement and interaction, drawing the viewer into the scene.

<!-- 

Rubens invented a new type of scene which he defined as neither sacred nor profane, although taken from the Holy Scriptures. Typical examples are the story of Hagar or the Susanna and the Elders. In this version of the subject by the gesture of one of the Elders, who silences Susanna by raising his finger to his lips, comes from the painting of the same subject by Rubens (1607-1608) (Galleria Borghese, Rome).
-  Susanna and the Elders is a biblical story from the Book of Daniel, in which a virtuous woman named Susanna is harassed by two elders who attempt to coerce her into sexual relations. When she refuses, they falsely accuse her of adultery, leading to a dramatic trial. The story highlights themes of virtue, justice, and divine intervention.
-  Artemisia Gentileschi's rendition of Susanna and the Elders is notable for its intense emotional expression and dramatic use of light and shadow, characteristic of the Baroque style. Gentileschi, one of the few prominent female artists of her time, brings a unique perspective to the subject, emphasizing Susanna's vulnerability and strength in the face of oppression. Her Susanna is not merely a passive victim but a complex character who embodies both innocence and resilience.
-  Artemisia's personal experiences, including her own trauma as a survivor of sexual assault, have led some art historians to interpret her depiction of Susanna as a reflection of her own struggles and a commentary on the societal treatment of women.

- this is the second paintings caravaggio made for  the cerasi family
- devine light from above illuminates saul who has fallen from his horse. his arms are outstretched in a gesture that echoes christ on the cross. the light reveals the physicality of saul's body, emphasizing the realism and immediacy of the moment.
- *naturalism:* the figures are depicted with a high degree of realism, with detailed attention to anatomy, clothing, and facial expressions. This naturalistic approach enhances the emotional impact of the scene, making it more relatable to viewers. The dirt on saul's feet and the realistic rendering of the horse contribute to this effect.
  - naturalism is unidealized, gritty, and raw: divine intervention happens in the real world, not some ethereal realm
#### the story
According to the New Testament, Saul was a zealous persecutor of Christians who, while traveling to Damascus to arrest followers of Jesus, experienced a profound spiritual transformation. A bright light from heaven suddenly surrounded him, causing him to fall to the ground and hear the voice of Jesus asking, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?" This event led to Saul's conversion to Christianity, after which he became known as Paul and went on to become one of the most influential apostles in spreading the Christian faith. (paul was blind for three days after the vision and was healed by ananias, a christian disciple in damascus; three days of darkness = baptism)

#### tenebrism
- tenebrism is an extreme form of chiaroscuro, characterized by the use of very pronounced contrasts between light and dark, where darkness becomes a dominating feature of the image. In tenebrism, the shadows are often deep and enveloping, with only a few areas of the composition illuminated by intense light. This technique creates a dramatic and theatrical effect, heightening the emotional intensity of the scene and drawing the viewer's attention to specific elements within the composition. 
- the root word "tenebroso" means "dark" or "gloomy" in Italian, reflecting the emphasis on darkness in this style. Tenebrism was particularly popular during the Baroque period and is often associated with the works of Caravaggio and his followers, who used this technique to enhance the dramatic impact of their paintings.

<!-- 
- las meninas (the maids of honor) is a complex and enigmatic painting that has been the subject of much analysis and interpretation. At first glance, it appears to be a straightforward depiction of a scene in the Spanish royal court, with the young Infanta Margaret Theresa surrounded by her attendants and Velázquez himself painting the scene. However, upon closer examination, the painting reveals multiple layers of meaning and challenges traditional notions of perspective, representation, and reality.
- meri barbola and nicolco pertusato, people with dwarfism, are positioned on either side of the composition, creating a sense of balance and symmetry. Their presence also adds a touch of humor and whimsy to the scene, contrasting with the formality of the royal court.
- the chapron and bodyguard in the background add depth and context to the scene, suggesting that the royal court is a complex and hierarchical social structure with various roles and responsibilities.
- at the doorway in the back, we see the figure of José Nieto Velázquez, the queen's chamberlain (meaning: ), who is either entering or leaving the room. His presence adds another layer of complexity to the composition, as he is positioned in a way that suggests movement and transition.
- queen mariana and king philip iv are reflected in the mirror on the back wall, suggesting that they are standing outside the frame of the painting, observing the scene. This creates a sense of ambiguity and challenges traditional notions of perspective and representation, as the viewer is left to wonder about the relationship between the figures in the painting and those outside of it. (beveled glass mirror) 
- when the flat mirror becomes available 
- no invention but a real room in the royal palace of madrid

- michel foucault's analysis: the painting is a meditation on the nature of representation and the relationship between reality and illusion. By including himself in the composition, Velázquez blurs the boundaries between artist and subject, challenging traditional notions of authorship and authority. The painting also raises questions about the nature of perception and the role of the viewer in interpreting and understanding art.


- velasquez elevates the status of the artist by portraying himself in the act of painting, suggesting that the creation of art is a noble and important endeavor. This self-referential aspect of the painting adds another layer of meaning, as it invites viewers to consider the role of the artist in society and the power of art to shape our understanding of the world.
- velasquez petitioned king philip iv to ennoble him as a knight of the order of santiago (spanish knighthood order). in las meninas, velasquez includes the insignia of the order on his chest, symbolizing his elevated status and recognition as a noble artist. this inclusion serves to assert the dignity and importance of the artist's role in society, challenging traditional hierarchies that placed artists below nobility. by portraying himself as a knight, velasquez not only celebrates his own achievements but also elevates the status of art and artists in general.(turned down twice before being granted the title posthumously)

-poussin was working for cardinal richelieu (pronounce: Richilu), who was a major patron of the arts and an influential political figure in france. richelieu's support allowed poussin to create works that reflected his classical ideals and intellectual pursuits. 
- he was originally from france but spent most of his career in rome, where he was deeply influenced by the art and culture of the italian renaissance and baroque periods. his time in rome allowed him to study the works of masters such as michelangelo, raphael, and caravaggio, which informed his own artistic style.

### Et in Arcadia ego

- classical baroque: clarity, order, balance, harmony
- the theme of mortality: even in idyllic arcadia (in classical antiquity it was considered a utopian land of peace and simplicity), death is present
- the shepherds are contemplating a tomb inscribed with the phrase "Et in Arcadia ego," which translates to "Even in Arcadia, there am I," referring to death. The painting serves as a memento mori, reminding viewers of the inevitability of death even in the most idyllic settings.
- the composition is carefully structured, with the figures arranged in a balanced and harmonious manner. The use of light and shadow is subtle, creating a sense of depth and volume without the dramatic contrasts seen in tenebrism.
- the figures are idealized and classical in style, reflecting Poussin's admiration for ancient Greek and Roman art. Their poses are calm and contemplative, emphasizing the intellectual nature of the scene.
- the landscape is serene and idyllic, with rolling hills and a peaceful atmosphere. This setting contrasts with the somber theme of mortality, creating a tension between the beauty of life and the inevitability of death.

PIZZA SAN PIETRO (grand piazza in front of st. peter's basilica)

- Bernini was the chief architect and designer of St. Peter's Square, the grand piazza in front of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The square was designed to accommodate large crowds of pilgrims and visitors to the basilica, and it serves as a monumental entrance to one of the most important religious sites in the world. 
- he was commissioned by Pope Alexander VII in 1656 to create the piazza, which was completed in 1667. The design of St. Peter's Square is characterized by its elliptical shape, which is surrounded by a colonnade of massive Tuscan columns arranged in four rows. The colonnade creates a sense of enclosure and grandeur, while also providing a visual connection between the basilica and the surrounding city.
- In addition to the colonnade, Bernini also designed the central obelisk and the two fountains that adorn the piazza. The obelisk, which dates back to ancient Egypt, was brought to Rome in the 1st century AD and was placed in its current location in St. Peter's Square by Bernini. The fountains, which were added later, complement the overall design of the piazza and enhance its aesthetic appeal.

TODO identify the places

Bernini, from 1629 architect to the fabric of St Peter's, was charged with systematizing the display of three Early Christian relics housed from 1606 in niches in the crossing piers flanking the apse: the head of the apostle Andrew; the lance of Longinus; and Veronica's veil. These relics, along with fragments of the True Cross brought to Rome by St Helena and transferred to St Peter's in 1629 by Urban VIII, were assembled by Bernini in the crossing. Each relic was honoured by the decoration of one of the giant piers. Bernini divided each pier into an upper and lower section. In the latter he created a large niche for a colossal marble statue of the saint, while the relic itself was commemorated in a tabernacle framed by a pair of spiral marble columns from the original Constantinian basilica, thus stressing the continuity of place.

The statues, some three times life-size, were designed by Bernini and carved by him and by sculptors working under his control: St Andrew by François Duquesnoy; St Longinus by Bernini; St Helena by Andrea Bolgi; and St Veronica by Francesco Mochi. In pairs and as a group they relate to the baldacchino. St Veronica and St Helena seem to direct their attention to and move towards the papal altar at which Christ's Passion is re-enacted during Mass. St Andrew and St Longinus, with arms outspread in wonder, look upward towards the top of the baldacchino. Bernini thus charged the space of the crossing with an unprecedented dramatic power, engaging spectators physically and psychologically and making them not merely witnesses but participants in the unfolding events.

The photo shows the crossing with St Veronica (left pier) and St Helena (right pier). The baldacchino is in the centre.

- Saint Longinus, the Roman centurion who pierced Christ's side with a lance, is depicted at the moment of his conversion, inspired by the sight of Christ's suffering. Bernini captures this transformative moment with dynamic movement and emotional intensity. Longinus is shown in a dramatic pose, his body twisting as he looks upward, his expression a mix of awe and revelation. The statue's swirling drapery and the upward gaze create a sense of ascension and spiritual awakening.

<!-- 

bernini's Saint Longinus and Donatello's St. George both depict saints in moments of action and transformation, but they do so in ways that reflect the distinct artistic styles and cultural contexts of their respective periods.

Donatello's St. George, created during the early Renaissance, embodies the ideals of humanism and classical antiquity. The statue portrays St. George as a poised and confident figure, standing in a contrapposto pose that emphasizes balance and harmony. His expression is calm and resolute, reflecting the Renaissance emphasis on rationality and the idealized human form. The sculpture is relatively restrained in its emotional expression, focusing more on the saint's heroic qualities and moral virtue.

- the sculpture is located in the Cornaro Chapel of the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome. It was commissioned by Cardinal Federico Cornaro as part of a larger decorative program for the chapel.
- The sculpture captures the moment of Saint Teresa's mystical experience, where she is said to have been pierced by an angel's arrow, leading to a profound spiritual ecstasy. Bernini masterfully conveys this intense moment through the dynamic composition and intricate details of the sculpture.
- Bernini's use of light is particularly noteworthy in this work.

title: Oppression and Global Baroque
level: 3

<!-- 

To twist the metaphor of the baroque pearl even further, we should add that the wonder, exuberance, and opulence that characterizes so many examples of the global Baroque often originated from violence, force, and coercion. Paradoxically, this violent global world witnessed artists of African descent, such as the painters Juan de Pareja and Juan Correa and the architect Antonio Francisco Lisboa (known as Aleijadinho), thriving as professional artists in Spain, Mexico, and Brazil, respectively.

We can’t deny that one strand of the global Baroque is its Catholic, monarchical, and colonizing nature

- Galileo Galilei's telescopic observations of the moon in 1609 revealed a rugged, mountainous surface, challenging the Aristotelian notion of celestial perfection. His detailed drawings, published in the Sidereus Nuncius (1610), depicted the moon's craters and valleys, demonstrating that it was not a smooth, flawless sphere but a world with its own topography. This empirical observation undermined the long-held belief in the incorruptibility and perfection of heavenly bodies, suggesting that they were subject to change and imperfection just like earthly objects.
