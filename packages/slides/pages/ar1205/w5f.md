- Buddhism in India began its decline starting in the 4th–6th century CE, with the process accelerating over centuries and largely completing by the 12th century.

### Janism: 
Janism did not went in decline like Buddhism, but it also did not spread widely. It is still practiced by a small percentage of the population in India, and it has had a significant influence on Indian culture and philosophy.

The Jain religion traces its roots to a spiritual leader called Mahavira (c. 599–527 bce), whom it regards as the last in a series of 24 saviors known as pathfinders (tirthankaras). Devotees seek through purification and moral action to become worthy of escaping the cycle of rebirth.

#### donors of Jain art
Jain monks live a life of austerity, and even laypeople avoid killing any living creature. The Jain commitment to nonviolence means that there are relatively few Jain kings in South Asian history, but this same commitment led many Jains to gravitate toward lucrative professions in banking and trade.

### The Dilwara Temples
- the Dilwara Temples erected on Mount Abu in Rajasthan, India

- modest exterior, but the interior is lavishly decorated with intricate marble carvings, including ceilings, pillars, and doorways. The temple is renowned for its exquisite craftsmanship and attention to detail, making it a significant example of Jain architecture and art.
- Every inch of these spaces is filled with deeply cut relief carvings in white marble whose complicated details had to be produced through **abrasion** and **rubbing rather than with a chisel**.

### Luna Vasahi (pronounced LOO-nah vah-SAH-hee)
- was built in 1230 by two brothers, Tejpala and Vastupala, who served as ministers to the local ruler.
- The main sanctuary is set in a courtyard surrounded by two columned arcades. These open to reveal the temple’s most impressive architectural feature, the ornate dome that crowns the **mandapa** hall.
- This corbeled dome is made of concentric bands of sculpted stone capped with a meticulously carved pendant which hangs down from the apex. Surrounding this decorative element are images of 16 goddesses of wisdom, attached individually to the surface of the dome.
- Every surface is adorned with narrative scenes, animals, protective deities, and plant motifs. These riotous forms highlight the calm, unadorned image of the tirthankara (pathfinders), which looks out from the quietude of the sanctuary

<!-- 
### Islamic Sultanate Architecture in India
Traders and merchants were the first to bring Islam to South Asia, but the backing of political rulers, which helped to establish it across the region, did not occur until the eighth century when Arab communities established a small territory near the Indus River. Later, beginning around 1000, Turkic factions from Central Asia, relatively recent converts to Islam, began military campaigns into north India—at first purely for plunder, then seeking territorial control. From the thirteenth century various Turkic and Afghan dynasties ruled portions of the subcontinent from the northern city of Delhi. These sultanates, as they are known, constructed forts, mausoleums, monuments, and mosques.

### Qutb
The first Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak of the Slave dynasty, so named because Aibak had begun his life as a soldier-slave

### Qutb complex
The mosque complex, called Quwwat ul-Islam (“strength of Islam”), was built over the citadel of Delhi’s previous rulers, and portions of the Jain and Hindu religious structures from this location were reused in the construction of the mosque. By far the most visible element of this complex is the tower known as the QUTB MINAR

### Qutb Minar
This minaret was begun by Aibak and completed under his successor, Iltutmish. It stands over 237 feet high and was among the tallest structures in South Asia at the time. It was constructed of sandstone in five segments, each of which is marked by the presence of a balcony that encircles the tower. The stories get smaller farther up the tower, and the final balcony rests on the top. Minarets are traditionally used to call Muslims to prayer, but this tower is too tall to serve that purpose easily and serves more clearly as an expression of power and political authority than as a functioning religious structure.

<!-- 
vijaayaanaagara (“city of victory”) was founded in 1336 by two brothers, Harihara and Bukka, who were former commanders in the army of the Delhi Sultanate. The empire’s capital was located at Vijayanagara (modern Hampi), a city that grew to be one of the largest in the world at the time, with a population of over half a million people.
- flurised between 1336 and 1565, when it was sacked by a coalition of Muslim sultanates. The ruins of the city, which are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, include palaces, temples, markets, lush gardens, stone arcades and other structures that reflect the empire’s wealth and cultural achievements.
- a trade hub that connected the Indian subcontinent with the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and it was known for its wealth and cultural achievements. The empire was a center of art, architecture, literature, and music, and it played a significant role in the development of South Indian culture.

<!-- 

After you enter through the gopura, then walk through the courtyard of the temple complex, you eventually pass by long verandas until you reach the mandapa (pillared hall). Inside, paintings decorate the ceiling of the mandapa (see the diagram above for the mandapa‘s location). They are divided into rectilinear boxes of various sizes portraying narrative scenes, like the marriage of Pampa and Virupaksha, in which figures are shown with faces in profile, large frontal eyes, and narrow waists rendered in a color palette of red, light blue, and black. The representation of figures is typical of the time more broadly.

The marriage of Pampa and Virupaksha is a classic example of “Sanskritization” whereby the local folk goddess marries a pan-Hindu god. As a form of Parvati, Shiva’s wife, the local deity becomes assimilated into the wider Indian pantheon, and Shiva becomes a part of the local temple site.

<!-- 

While the temples in Vijayanagara tend to follow conservative South Indian architectural forms, the civic architecture exhibits hybrid forms that reflect the religious and ethnic diversity of the city’s population. This appropriation of diverse architectural techniques is apparent in the royal ELEPHANT STABLES (FIG. 24–6).
- both traditional South Indian architectural forms and elements associated with Islamic (or Sultanate) architecture, arch and dome,
- elephents had ceremonial and practical importance in the city, and the stables were designed to accommodate up to 11 elephants, with separate stalls for each animal. The stables are an important example of the fusion of architectural styles that characterized the Vijayanagara Empire and reflect the cultural diversity of the city.
- the pavilion in the center most likely served as a viewing platform for the royal family to watch the elephants being groomed and cared for or musicians 
- the individual chambers are placed in a row and alternate between two types: one with a vaulted ceiling and the other with a domed ceiling. The vaulted chambers (conical vault) are more traditional in South Indian architecture, while the domed chambers are more closely associated with Islamic architecture. The stables also feature decorative elements such as carved stone screens and intricate reliefs that depict scenes of elephants and other animals.

A large water tank (pushpakarni), close to the Mahanavami Dibba and square in shape, encompasses multiple steps in a semi-pyramidal configuration of black schist stone leading down to the next level. Its configuration allowed people to easily get in and out of the water. Fed by the nearby Tungabhadra River through an aqueduct system, the reservoir was probably used by royal members for ritual bathing and cleansing before prayers, or for the immersion of metal embodiments of deities during religious ceremonies.

<!-- 
- the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, Tamil Naidu, India, is a significant Hindu temple dedicated to the goddess Meenakshi, a form of Parvati (Parvati is a principal Hindu goddess, revered as the nurturing, benevolent manifestation of Shakti (divine feminine energy) and the consort of Lord Shiva), and her consort Sundareswarar, a form of Shiva. The temple is renowned for its stunning Dravidian architecture, intricate carvings, and vibrant gopurams (gateway towers). It serves as an important religious and cultural center in South India and attracts millions of devotees and tourists each year.
- founded 14th century, but the current structure was built in the 16th century during the Nayak dynasty. The temple complex consists of several shrines, halls, and courtyards, with the main sanctum dedicated to Meenakshi and Sundareswarar. The temple is also famous for its annual Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival, which celebrates the divine marriage of Meenakshi and Sundareswarar.
- As a temple city grew, it needed bigger enclosing walls and thus new gateways. successive rulers added new gopurams, and the temple complex grew in size and grandeur. As a result, the tallest structures in temple cities are often at the periphery, rather than at the center, which is the opposite of what we see in many other religious traditions. 
- 11 gopurams, the tallest of which is the southern gopuram, which stands at 170 feet (52 meters) tall.

The temple's architecture is characterized by its intricate carvings, vibrant colors, and elaborate ornamentation, making it a significant example of Dravidian temple architecture in South India.
- successive layers of paint are applied to the sculptures every 12 years during a special festival called the Kumbhabhishekam, which involves the consecration of the temple and its deities. This process helps to preserve the vibrant colors and intricate details of the sculptures, ensuring that they remain a stunning visual spectacle for visitors and devotees alike.

## Mughal Period

![Basawan and Chetar, "Akbar" from the Akbarnama, c. 1586–89, Mughal Empire, each page 33 x 30 cm ](http://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/akbarnama_both_800px.jpg)


<!-- 

The Mughals, like many of the Delhi sultans, came from Central Asia. Muhammad Zahir-ud-Din, known as Babur (“Lion” or “Panther”), was the first Mughal emperor of India (ruled 1526–1530). He emphasized his Turkic heritage, though he had equally impressive Mongol ancestry. After some initial conquests in Central Asia, he amassed an empire stretching from Afghanistan to Delhi, which he conquered in 1526.

The third emperor,Akbar (ruled 1556–1605), the third ruler, extended Mughal control over most of north India, and under his two successors, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, northern India was generally unified by 1658. The Mughal Empire lasted until 1858, when the last Mughal emperor was deposed and exiled to Burma (today’s Myanmar) by the British.

Akbar was a champion of new styles in literature, architecture, music, and painting. Although his son Jahangir later chronicled that Akbar was illiterate, it is most likely that Akbar was dyslexic, which would have made it very difficult for him to read.  Despite this personal challenge, at the time of his death in 1605 the imperial library contained 24,000 volumes, and the number of painters in the imperial workshop had expanded greatly. Much like his political policies, which encouraged tolerance, Akbar’s court included artists from all regions of India, creating a melting pot of techniques and styles. As a result, Mughal painting under Akbar the Great is known for its unique blend of indigenous Indian, Persian, and Western traditions.

### Hybrid art
The Mughals followed in this tradition, synthesizing Indian, Persian, and Central Asian elements for their forts, palaces, mosques, tombs, and cenotaphs.

In creating the Akbarnama, the artists in Akbar’s atelier were equally proficient at blending elements from Indian, Persian, and Western traditions, while developing a distinct style of their own. In the illustration of the elephant hunt from the Akbarnama, they have retained the vertical format favored in Persian painting, as well as its traditionally intricate patterning of nature, seen in the rhythmic pulsing of the waves. In the right panel, the onlookers express fear and awe through the standardized Persian gesture of lightly pressing a finger to the lips. Yet many other figures are seen with their arms thrown overhead in distress, or with their bodies positioned off-balance, demonstrating the artists’ independence in choosing whether or not to utilize standard gestures.

 Elements from Western artistic traditions are also present, most notably the indication of depth and distance achieved by rendering the boats and buildings as increasingly small as one looks to the top of the page.  

### Akbarnameh

not a biography but a chronicle of his reign

In these small, brilliantly-colored paintings from the Akbarnama (Book of Akbar), a rampaging elephant crashes over a bridge of boats on the River Jumna, in front of the Agra Fort. He is so out of control that his tusks, trunk, and front leg burst through the edge of the frame (see image below). Several nearby men scramble to get out of the way, clinging to the edges of their boats or leaping into the water for safety. The accompanying right page shows a swirling mass of onlookers, each expressing distress and astonishment at the event unfolding before their eyes.

The scene is a royal elephant hunt where the Mughal emperor, Akbar, has mounted Hawa’i—an elephant known for its wild and uncontrollable disposition—to fight the equally fierce elephant Ran Bagha, who leads them on a wild chase across the river. The most prominent onlooker is the Prime Minister Ataga Khan, who holds his hands in prayer for a peaceful resolution to this chaotic scene. In the midst of the turmoil, we see Emperor Akbar, upright and unfazed, riding barefoot on the royal elephant—the very embodiment of majestic strength, courage, and faith in divine protection (below). 

**These illustrations encapsulate, both symbolically and literally, the significant achievements of this remarkable man as told in the Akbarnama, the book he commissioned as the official chronicle of his reign.** (Akbar's deeds)

<!-- 

Akbar ’s son and successor, was a connoisseur of painting; he had his own workshop, which he established even before he became emperor. His focus on detail was much greater than that of his father.

Portraits became a major art under Jahangir. We can only speculate on the target audience for the portrait Jahangir commissioned of himself with the Safavid-dynasty Persian ruler, Shah Abbas. The painting of JAHANGIR AND SHAH ABBAS (FIG. 24–10) is of such small size it could not be publicly displayed and was, therefore, certainly not intended for Jahangir’s subjects. But because we know that paintings were commonly conveyed by embassies from one kingdom to another, it may have been intended to be taken, or even just seen, by one of Shah Abbas’s representatives at court.

At first glance this painting of two rulers embracing seems to tell of a close bond of friendship between the men. The presence of a lion and lamb laying peacefully together, an ancient symbol of harmony, also appears to bolster this interpretation. Indeed, the fact that the men are framed by the sun and moon while standing on a map of the world might imply that these bonds of trust and peace extend even to their respective states. Yet nothing could be further from the truth.

This painting was created in a moment of high tension between Shah Abbas and the Mughal throne. The trouble centered on Kandahar in Afghanistan. The prosperous city had been given to Shah Abbas’s ancestor by the Mughal emperor Humayun, but later, in the time of Akbar, the Mughals took back control of the city. Shah Abbas then waited for a chance to reclaim it, believing it was his right to do so. When the Mughals were distracted by civil conflict in South Asia, he seized the opportunity and recaptured Kandahar in a swift assault. He immediately made conciliatory gestures to Jahangir, who was furious but unable to spare the military force needed to retake the city.

Another look at the painting reveals new details. Jahangir is depicted much larger than Shah Abbas, who appears to bow deferentially to the Mughal emperor. Jahangir’s head is centered in the halo and he stands on the predatory lion, whose body spans a vast territory, including Shah Abbas’s own holdings in Afghanistan and Iran. These details invert the initial impression conveyed by the subject, revealing a new meaning. The painting, cloaked in the diplomatic language of cordiality and reconciliation, is a strong reminder of Mughal superiority and a potent warning against further expansion

<!-- 

Despite the proliferation of portrait painting, depictions of court women occur rarely in Mughal art, due in part to the restricted access male painters had to the women’s quarters. An important exception to this was Jahangir’s favorite wife, Empress Nur Jahan, of whom a few images exist. As Jahangir grew older he succumbed to addiction and illness. During this period, in which he was largely incapacitated, Nur Jahan ran the empire on his behalf, carrying his seal and issuing decrees in his name. Although she ruled in Jahangir’s name, the images of her at court and the imperial coins that bore her name suggest her role was no secret. 

The idyllic scene depicted in FIGURE 24–11 portrays Nur Jahan serving food and drink to Jahangir and his son by another wife, Prince Khurram. Seated on ornate carpets the royal family members sit near a fountain as court women bring food and wave fans. This deceptively harmonious tableau is qualified by the verses in Persian surrounding the painting. These refer to Jahangir’s displeasure over Khurram’s attempts to take the throne, an outcome that Nur Jahan also wished to prevent. After Jahangir died, however, and Nur Jahan was confined to her palace, Khurram managed to seize the throne, taking the royal name Shah Jahan.

Built between  1631 and 1648 on the banks of the Jamuna River, it was commissioned as a mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah Jahan, who is believed to have taken a major part in overseeing its design and construction. Shah Jahan’s personal motivations add a poignancy to this structure, but it must also be recalled that this was the first major architectural undertaking of Shah Jahan’s reign.

- personal loss and authority

As visitors enter through a monumental, hall-like gate, the tomb rises before them across a spacious garden set with long reflecting pools (SEE FIG. 24–1). Measuring some 1,000 by 1,900 feet, the enclosure is unobtrusively divided into quadrants planted with trees and flowers, and framed by broad walkways and stone inlaid in geometric patterns. In Shah Jahan’s time, fruit trees and cypresses—symbolic of life and death, respectively—lined the walkways, and fountains played in the shallow pools. Collectively these features evoked paradise on earth.

<!-- 

The tomb is flanked by two smaller structures not visible in FIGURE 24–1, one a mosque and the other a hall designed to mirror it. Like the entrance hall, they are made mostly of red sandstone, rendering even more startling the full glory of the tomb’s white marble, a material previously reserved for the tombs of saints and here implying an elevated religious stature for Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal.

The tomb is raised higher than these structures on its own marble platform, emphasizing its importance.

Inside, the Taj Mahal invokes the hasht behisht (“eight paradises”) with the eight small chambers that ring the interior—one at each corner and one behind each iwan, a vaulted opening with an arched portal that is a typical feature of eastern Islamic architecture.

<!-- 

Upon entering the gateway that today serves as the entrance to the great Taj Mahal complex, the visitor beholds the majestic white marble structure that is one of the world’s best-known monuments. Its reflection shimmers in the pools of the garden meant to evoke a vision of paradise as described in the Qur’an. The building’s façades are delicately inlaid with inscriptions designed by India’s foremost calligrapher of the time, Amanat Khan, and floral arabesques in semiprecious stones: carnelian, agate, coral, turquoise, garnet, lapis, and jasper. Above, its luminous white marble dome reflects each shift in light, flushing rose at dawn, dissolving in its own brilliance in the noonday sun. This extraordinary building—originally and appropriately called the Illuminated Tomb and only since the nineteenth century known as the TAJ MAHAL (FIG. 24–1)—was built between 1631 and 1648 by the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth, and likely as a tomb for himself.


This aggrandizement of the tomb is further achieved by having the minarets flank the tomb rather than the mosque. The minarets’ three levels correspond to those of the tomb, creating a bond between them. Crowning each minaret is a chattri (pavilion). Traditional embellishments of Indian palaces, chattris quickly passed into the vocabulary of Indian Islamic architecture, where they appear prominently. A lucid geometric symmetry pervades the tomb. It is basically square, but its chamfered (sliced-off) corners create a subtle octagon.

Measured to the base of the finial (the spire at the top), the tomb is almost exactly as tall as it is wide. Each façade is identical, with a central iwan flanked by two stories of smaller iwans. By creating voids in the façades, these iwans contribute to the building’s sense of weightlessness. On the roof, four octagonal chattris, one at each corner, create a visual transition to the lofty, bulbous dome. Framed but not obscured by the chattris, the dome rises gracefully and is lifted higher by its drum than in earlier Mughal tombs, allowing the swelling curves and elegant lines of its surprisingly large form to emerge with perfect clarity.

The pristine surfaces of the Taj Mahal are embellished with utmost subtlety (FIG. 24–12). Even the sides of the platform on which the Taj Mahal stands are carved in relief with a blind arcade (decorative arches set into a wall) motif and carved relief panels of flowers. The portals are framed with verses from the Qur’an and inlaid in black marble, while the spandrels are decorated with floral arabesques inlaid in colored semiprecious stones, a technique known by its Italian name, pietra dura. Not strong enough to detract from the overall purity of the white marble, the embellishments enliven the surfaces of this impressive yet delicate masterpiece.

Seated on a tiered landscape, with eyes closed in sleep, the Christ Child ponders his eventual role on earth, as sacrifice for the sins of humans. Standing on a crescent moon with hands clasped at her chest, the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception gazes towards the viewer. These two statuettes are examples of a large number of ivory figural types created in Goa and Sri Lanka during the time of Portuguese rule that began in the 16th century. [1] For this reason, these small sculptures are often referred to as Indo-Portuguese in scholarship and by museums.

The arrival of Vasco da Gama’s fleet to Calicut in 1498 marked the beginning of Portuguese evangelization in the lands along the Malabar (southwestern) Coast of India. [3] The Portuguese saw themselves as promoting and spreading Christian ideas and values, part of a global Catholic missionary enterprise that sought to convert non-Christians to the faith. 

By the early sixteenth century, the Portuguese had established themselves in Goa, a small state on the western coast of India, with the goals of dominating the spice trade and promoting the Christian faith. Various Christian religious orders came to Goa at this time to begin the process of converting the mostly Hindu population of Goa. For the mission enterprise, churches were constructed, and small, portable images of the Catholic divine were carved in ivory and wood. Larger wooden sculptures depicting Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Catholic saints were also created to adorn the interior of the churches. These sacred spaces and divine figures would serve to shelter, teach, and convert the population of Goa to Christianity.

In Old Goa, the former capital of Portuguese India, there are numerous churches that reflect European influence, such as the Sé Cathedral and the Church of Bom Jesus, with the former composed of a nave and side aisles of equal height. These churches recall those in Lisbon, with images of the Christian divine adorning the main altar and side altars.

The Jesuits brought small paintings, prints, and sculptures from Europe for the Indian sculptors to use as models for creating artworks for their missionary enterprise. Prints were the most common European model used in the Goan workshops, due to their low cost and easy transport

<!-- 
As Buddhism declined in the land of its origin, it continued to thrive in Southeast Asia, where it was shaped and developed in new ways. As it gained adherents among the population, rulers at times found it vital to align themselves with Buddhist ideas. Yet the individual incentives for espousing Buddhist ideas were as varied as the artistic forms they employed.


When Khmer king Jayavarman VII took the throne of Angkor in 1181, it marked the end of a long struggle against internal rebellions and foreign invaders. During his reign, he raised up the kingdom of Angkor in a final flowering, building more than any of his royal predecessors. In an unusual move, he elected to associate himself with the Buddha, rather than with a Hindu deity, and in so doing adapted Buddhist ideas to the Khmer concept of the god-king or, in his case, the buddha-king (buddharaja).

This consistency has led scholars to believe that these works are in fact portraits of Jayavarman VII seated serenely in the guise of the Buddha. Just as his ancestors had linked themselves  with Hindu deities, Jayavarman VII represented himself as a Buddha: with downturned, meditative eyes, distended earlobes, hair pulled back into a topknot, and a simple garment.

<!-- 

n northern Burma from the eleventh to the thirteenth century, rulers raised thousands of religious monuments—temples, monasteries, and stupas—in the Bagan Plain, following the scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. To the south arose the port city now called Yangon (founded as Dagon and also formerly known as Rangoon). Established by Mon rulers before the eleventh century, Yangon is the site of the SHWEDAGON STUPA (FIG. 24–19), which enshrines relics of the four past Buddhas, including hair from Shakyamuni. The modern structures of Shwedagon (“Golden Dagon”) rise from an ancient Mon core that was rebuilt and enlarged in the fourteenth century. In subsequent decades it underwent continual restoration and enhancement by pious Burmese kings and queens.

The bell-shaped spire is capped by an umbrella-like ornament (hti) adorned with a large diamond, and the sides of the terraces are covered in gold plate. While most of this wealth was donated by royalty, over the centuries people from all walks of life have offered gold for its construction and maintenance.

![Temple complex Wat Phra Kaew](https://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Temple-complex-Wat-Phra-Kaew.jpg)

<!-- 

The Dvaravati culture remained regionally dominant until Khmer invasions in the tenth century. During this turmoil a new ethnic group, the Thai, entered the scene from the north, gradually gaining control and adopting Buddhism, as well as some aspects of Hinduism, from the Mon. **The first Thai kingdom, Sukhothai, was established in 1238 and  flourished under the guidance of kings like the renowned Ram Khamhaeng before falling to rival Thai states**. The Sukhothai period was a formative time of innovation in Thai art. Among the creations of Sukhothai artists was an elegant new style of Buddha image. Featuring draping, almost boneless, limbs and attenuated heads adorned with spire-like flames, the Buddha images of this period are immediately recognizable. Art historians have explored diverse explanations for the distinctive, otherworldly features of Sukhothai Buddhas. One strong possibility is that they are literally poetry given tangible form (see “Closer Look” on page 800). The artists may have been working from descriptions found in the Indian Buddhist texts, which use evocative similes to describe the Buddha’s beautiful appearance.


Despite its cultural importance, the kingdom of Sukhothai did not last long, giving way to a succession of dynasties. **The capital was eventually moved south to Bangkok, and under the rule of the Chakri king Rama I,** construction began there on a grand new temple to house the Thais’ most sacred Buddha image.

### Wat Phra Kaew, Bangkok, Thailand

Wat Phra Kaew (also known as the Temple of the Emerald Buddha) is arguably the most important Buddhist temple in Thailand; however, it is not a Buddhist monastery as neither monks nor nuns use the temple complex as their residence or primary place of congregation. Instead, Wat Phra Kaew was once the private chapel to the kings of Thailand and members of the court. Today, like the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Thailand, where the temple complex is located, it is open to the public. The temple or wat was completed in 1783 under the patronage of King Rama I to enshrine the Emerald Buddha (Phra Kaew) for which it was named. 

The Emerald Buddha (“emerald” refers to its color; it is actually made of jadeite) is featured in legends that place its creation in India under the direction of major Buddhist figures and trace its travels through great Buddhist nations  of the past. These stories, although not grounded in historical evidence, suggest that the image has a special link to the world’s foremost Buddhist kings, among whose lineage the Thai king is the most recent. The king himself ritually changes the image’s golden garments three times a year. In one of these costumes the Emerald Buddha is dressed as a king, further strengthening the association between the Buddha and the state.

Wat Phra Kaew is not a singular building; instead, it refers to a temple complex that includes a variety of structures. This essay will focus on the ordination hall or ubosot, which is traditionally considered one of the most important structures at a Buddhist temple as well as a gallery of mural paintings that encircles the temple complex.
