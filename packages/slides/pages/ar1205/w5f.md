- Buddhism in India began its decline starting in the 4th–6th century CE, with the process accelerating over centuries and largely completing by the 12th century.

### Janism: 
Janism did not went in decline like Buddhism, but it also did not spread widely. It is still practiced by a small percentage of the population in India, and it has had a significant influence on Indian culture and philosophy.

The Jain religion traces its roots to a spiritual leader called Mahavira (c. 599–527 bce), whom it regards as the last in a series of 24 saviors known as pathfinders (tirthankaras). Devotees seek through purification and moral action to become worthy of escaping the cycle of rebirth. 

#### donors of Jain art
Jain monks live a life of austerity, and even laypeople avoid killing any living creature. The Jain commitment to nonviolence means that there are relatively few Jain kings in South Asian history, but this same commitment led many Jains to gravitate toward lucrative professions in banking and trade.

### The Dilwara Temples
- the Dilwara Temples erected on Mount Abu in Rajasthan, India

- modest exterior, but the interior is lavishly decorated with intricate marble carvings, including ceilings, pillars, and doorways. The temple is renowned for its exquisite craftsmanship and attention to detail, making it a significant example of Jain architecture and art.
- Every inch of these spaces is filled with deeply cut relief carvings in white marble whose complicated details had to be produced through **abrasion** and **rubbing rather than with a chisel**.

### Luna Vasahi (pronounced LOO-nah vah-SAH-hee)
- was built in 1230 by two brothers, Tejpala and Vastupala, who served as ministers to the local ruler.
- The main sanctuary is set in a courtyard surrounded by two columned arcades. These open to reveal the temple’s most impressive architectural feature, the ornate dome that crowns the **mandapa** hall.
- This corbeled dome is made of concentric bands of sculpted stone capped with a meticulously carved pendant which hangs down from the apex. Surrounding this decorative element are images of 16 goddesses of wisdom, attached individually to the surface of the dome.
- Every surface is adorned with narrative scenes, animals, protective deities, and plant motifs. These riotous forms highlight the calm, unadorned image of the tirthankara (pathfinders), which looks out from the quietude of the sanctuary

### Islamic Sultanate Architecture in India
Traders and merchants were the first to bring Islam to South Asia, but the backing of political rulers, which helped to establish it across the region, did not occur until the eighth century when Arab communities established a small territory near the Indus River. Later, beginning around 1000, Turkic factions from Central Asia, relatively recent converts to Islam, began military campaigns into north India—at first purely for plunder, then seeking territorial control. From the thirteenth century various Turkic and Afghan dynasties ruled portions of the subcontinent from the northern city of Delhi. These sultanates, as they are known, constructed forts, mausoleums, monuments, and mosques.

### Qutb
The first Delhi Sultanate was founded in 1206 by Qutb-ud-din Aibak of the Slave dynasty, so named because Aibak had begun his life as a soldier-slave

### Qutb complex
The mosque complex, called Quwwat ul-Islam (“strength of Islam”), was built over the citadel of Delhi’s previous rulers, and portions of the Jain and Hindu religious structures from this location were reused in the construction of the mosque. By far the most visible element of this complex is the tower known as the QUTB MINAR

### Qutb Minar
This minaret was begun by Aibak and completed under his successor, Iltutmish. It stands over 237 feet high and was among the tallest structures in South Asia at the time. It was constructed of sandstone in five segments, each of which is marked by the presence of a balcony that encircles the tower. The stories get smaller farther up the tower, and the final balcony rests on the top. Minarets are traditionally used to call Muslims to prayer, but this tower is too tall to serve that purpose easily and serves more clearly as an expression of power and political authority than as a functioning religious structure.

<!-- 

Upon entering the gateway that today serves as the entrance to the great Taj Mahal complex, the visitor beholds the majestic white marble structure that is one of the world’s best-known monuments. Its reflection shimmers in the pools of the garden meant to evoke a vision of paradise as described in the Qur’an. The building’s façades are delicately inlaid with inscriptions designed by India’s foremost calligrapher of the time, Amanat Khan, and floral arabesques in semiprecious stones: carnelian, agate, coral, turquoise, garnet, lapis, and jasper. Above, its luminous white marble dome reflects each shift in light, flushing rose at dawn, dissolving in its own brilliance in the noonday sun. This extraordinary building—originally and appropriately called the Illuminated Tomb and only since the nineteenth century known as the TAJ MAHAL (FIG. 24–1)—was built between 1631 and 1648 by the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in childbirth, and likely as a tomb for himself.

Inside, the Taj Mahal invokes the hasht behisht (“eight paradises”) with the eight small chambers that ring the interior—one at each corner and one behind each iwan, a vaulted opening with an arched portal that is a typical feature of eastern Islamic architecture.

On one side is a mosque, while opposite and very similar in appearance is a building that may have served as a rest house. The enormous garden, both in front of the building and in its continuation on the opposite side of the Jamuna River, lends a lush setting consistent with Islamic notions of paradise

In two stories (for a total of 16 chambers), the rooms ring the octagonal central area, which rises the full two stories to a domed ceiling that is lower than the outer dome. In this central chamber, surrounded by a finely carved octagonal openwork marble screen, are the exquisite inlaid cenotaphs (funerary monuments to someone whose remains lie elsewhere) of Shah Jahan and his wife, whose actual tombs lie in the crypt below.
