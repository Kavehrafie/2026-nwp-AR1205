- the figures are crowded into a shallow, gold-grounded space
- The spatial recession is minimal, and there is little sense of a coherent architectural setting

Linear Perspective and the Renaissance in Italy

Powerful families divided the Italian peninsula into city-states: the Medici in Florence, the Visconti and Sforza in Milan, the Montefeltro 
in Urbino, the Gonzaga in Mantua, and the Este in Ferrara. After 1420, the popes ruled Rome, while in the south Naples and Sicily were 
French and then Spanish (Aragonese) territories. Venice maintained its independence as a republic

- cities grew wealthy through commerce and banking
- wealthy families became patrons of the arts
- competition among city-states fostered artistic innovation
  - As one Florentine merchant, Giovanni Rucellai, succinctly noted, he supported the arts “because they serve the glory of God, the honour of the city, and the commemoration of myself” (cited in Baxandall, p. 2)

-  The period saw the rise of mercenary  armies led by entrepreneurial (and sometimes brilliant) military commanders called condottieri, who owed allegiance only to those who paid them 

The term Renaissance (French for “rebirth”) was only applied to this period by later historians

Perspective and Portaiture embody Humanist ideals in Early Renaissance Art

"The Renaissance represented the human subject, whom it celebrated as the individual, in two ways, once by painting portraits of individuals and once by painting the viewer's gaze" (Belting 18)

Whereas the natural world is characterized by an unpredictable flow of visual phenomena on which no logical schema can be imposed, perspective depicts the world as only the imagination can see it. It constructs the world for a symbolic gaze.

Alhazen 

Diagrams illustrating the structure of the eye were widespread in antiquity and the Middle Ages, commonly found in manuscripts and papyri. These visual aids helped explain complex physiological and optical theories about vision. The two dominant theories were intromission, which posited that light entered the eye and was processed into stimuli, and **extramission**, which suggested that rays from the eye gathered information from objects.

After Euclid and Ptolemy, a key contribution to optics came from the Islamic Golden Age through Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965–1040), known in the West as Alhazen.

Ibn al-Haytham’s experiments, detailed in "Kitab al-Manazir" (Latin: "De aspectibus"), supported the intromission theory by showing that light travels into the eye, refuting the earlier **extramission** view.

This diagram, from Ibn al-Haytham's Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics), details the structure of the human visual system (wrote between 1011 and 1021). It portrays the eyes and their connection to the brain through optical pathways. The circular structures represent the eyes, with intricate lines illustrating the journey of light rays as they enter the eyes, refract, and are processed to form visual images. The Arabic inscriptions describe various anatomical components, such as the eye's lens, optic nerve, and other parts involved in vision. This diagram exemplifies Ibn al-Haytham’s blend of geometric optics and anatomical insight.

### Ibn al-Haytham’s Camera Obscura

This illustration shows how light shines through a small hole in the darkened room, projecting an inverted image on the opposite sheet. He called this “Qamara”, the world’s first Camera Obscura.
