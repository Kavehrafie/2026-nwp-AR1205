<!-- 

Until roughly the fourteenth century, artists were typically grouped among the “mechanical arts.” This broad field included professions ranging from agriculture to architecture and was distinguished from the more lofty field of the “liberal arts.” While the liberal arts were valued higher because they stressed one’s intellectual abilities, the mechanical arts garnered less esteem because they were generally considered manual labor. (even Cosmimo de’ Medici referred to artists as “workers in paint”)

Pressures to elevate the artistic profession, however, began in earnest in the midst of the rising Renaissance era. Organizations, for example, specifically oriented toward artistic networking and training began to appear. Prior to this moment, those practices relegated to the mechanical arts were often guided by various guilds. For example, artists would have been grouped into the Arte de Medici e Speziali (a guild for doctors and apothecaries). Around the mid-fourteenth century, though, the Compagnia di San Luca took shape in Florence. Though the structure of this confraternity was not that distinct from earlier guilds—both organizational types could be defined as groups of individuals united by a role, be it devotional or professional—the Compagnia was nevertheless notable as it was one of the first confraternities designed solely for artistic members.

Alhazen 

Diagrams illustrating the structure of the eye were widespread in antiquity and the Middle Ages, commonly found in manuscripts and papyri. These visual aids helped explain complex physiological and optical theories about vision. The two dominant theories were intromission, which posited that light entered the eye and was processed into stimuli, and **extramission**, which suggested that rays from the eye gathered information from objects.

After Euclid and Ptolemy, a key contribution to optics came from the Islamic Golden Age through Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (965–1040), known in the West as Alhazen.

Ibn al-Haytham’s experiments, detailed in "Kitab al-Manazir" (Latin: "De aspectibus"), supported the intromission theory by showing that light travels into the eye, refuting the earlier **extramission** view.

This diagram, from Ibn al-Haytham's Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics), details the structure of the human visual system (wrote between 1011 and 1021). It portrays the eyes and their connection to the brain through optical pathways. The circular structures represent the eyes, with intricate lines illustrating the journey of light rays as they enter the eyes, refract, and are processed to form visual images. The Arabic inscriptions describe various anatomical components, such as the eye's lens, optic nerve, and other parts involved in vision. This diagram exemplifies Ibn al-Haytham’s blend of geometric optics and anatomical insight.

### Ibn al-Haytham’s Camera Obscura

This illustration shows how light shines through a small hole in the darkened room, projecting an inverted image on the opposite sheet. He called this “Qamara”, the world’s first Camera Obscura.

<!-- 

In 1401, the building supervisors of the baptistery of Florence Cathedral decided to commission a new pair of bronze doors, funded by the powerful wool merchants’ guild. Instead of choosing a well-established sculptor with a strong reputation, a competition was announced for the commission. This prestigious project would be awarded to the artist who demonstrated the greatest talent in executing a trial piece: a bronze relief representing Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac (Genesis 22:1–13) composed within the same Gothic quatrefoil framework used in Andrea Pisano’s first set of bronze doors for the baptistery, made in the 1330s Lorenzo Ghiberti, both young artists in their early twenties.

Brunelleschi’s (Brunelleschi had originally trained as a goldsmith) composition is rugged and explosive, marked by raw dramatic intensity. At the right, Abraham lunges forward, grabbing his son by the neck, while the angel swoops to stop him just as the knife is about to strike. Isaac’s awkward pose embodies his fear and struggle. Ghiberti’s version is quite different, suave and graceful rather than powerful and dramatic. Poses are controlled and choreographed; the harmonious pairing of son and father contrasts sharply with the wrenching struggle in Brunelleschi’s rendering. And Ghiberti’s Isaac is not a stretched, scrawny youth, but a fully idealized Classical figure exuding calm composure.

is possible, however, that the cloth merchants actually chose Ghiberti to make the doors. They might have preferred the elegance of his figural composition. Perhaps they liked the prominence of gracefully arranged swags of cloth, reminders of the source of their patronage and prosperity. But they also could have been swayed by the technical superiority of Ghiberti’s relief. Unlike Brunelleschi, Ghiberti cast background and figures mostly as a single piece, making his bronze stronger, lighter, and less expensive to produce.

<!-- 

The defining civic project of the early years of the fifteenth century was the completion of Florence Cathedral with a magnificent dome over the high altar. The construction of the cathedral had begun in the late thirteenth century and had continued intermittently during the fourteenth. As early as 1367, builders had envisioned a very tall dome to span the huge interior space of the crossing, but they lacked the engineering know-how to construct it. When interest in completing the cathedral revived around 1407, the technical solution was proposed by the young sculp- tor-turned-architect Filippo Brunelleschi.

Brunellschi had studied the ruins of ancient Roman buildings, including the Pantheon with its massive unreinforced concrete dome. He understood that to build a dome of such size required a different approach than the traditional method of centering, which involved constructing a wooden framework to support the masonry during construction. Given the size of the dome, this would have been impossible. After the completion of a tall octagonal drum in 1412, Brunelleschi designed the dome itself in 1417, and it was built between 1420 and 1436

Brunelleschi’s design for the dome was revolutionary. Instead of using the traditional method of centering (a wooden framework to support the masonry during construction), which would have been impossible given the size of the dome, he devised a double-shell structure with a herringbone pattern of brickwork that allowed the dome to support itself as it rose. This innovative approach not only solved the engineering challenges but also resulted in a visually stunning and structurally sound dome that remains an iconic symbol of Renaissance architecture.

<!-- 

A revolutionary feat of engineering, the dome is a double shell of masonry 138 feet (= 42 meters) across. The octagonal outer shell is supported on 8 large and 16 lighter ribs. Instead of using a costly and even dangerous scaffold and centering, Brunelleschi devised a system in which temporary wooden supports were cantilevered out from the drum. He moved these supports up as building pro- gressed.

An oculus (round opening) in the center of the dome was topped with a lantern designed in 1436. After Brunelleschi’s death, this crowning structure, made up of Roman architectural forms, was completed by another Florentine architect, Michelozzo di Bartolomeo (1396–1472). The final touch—a gilt-bronze ball by Andrea del Verrocchio—was added in 1468–1471 (but replaced in 1602 with a smaller one).

compare to sultan khodabandeh tomb in iran: 
- Both domes are double-shelled structures, which was an innovative architectural technique at the time.
- Both domes are supported by a series of ribs that provide structural integrity.
- Both domes feature an octagonal base, which is a common design element in Islamic architecture.
- the size of the domes: Brunelleschi's dome is significantly larger, with a diameter of 42 meters, while the dome of Sultan Khodabandeh's tomb is smaller in scale.

<!-- 

Brunelleschi’s architectural style is characterized by its emphasis on symmetry, proportion, and the use of classical elements such as columns, pilasters, and arches. His designs often feature a harmonious balance between form and function, with a focus on creating spaces that are both aesthetically pleasing and practical.

San Lorenzo, the parish church of the Medici family, was one of Brunelleschi’s earliest architectural commissions. The original structure dated from the twelfth century, but by the early fifteenth century it was in a state of disrepair. Brunelleschi was tasked with redesigning and rebuilding the church, which he did in a manner that reflected his innovative architectural style. 

The interior of San Lorenzo is characterized by its clear geometric forms and harmonious proportions. The nave is flanked by a series of Corinthian columns that support rounded arches, creating a rhythmic sequence that guides the eye towards the altar. The use of light is also a key feature of Brunelleschi’s design, with large windows allowing natural light to flood the interior space, enhancing the sense of openness and tranquility.

For the base of the niche, Donatello carved a remark-
able shallow relief showing St. George slaying the dragon
and saving the princess, a well-known part of his story. The
contours of the foreground figures are slightly undercut to
emphasize their mass, while the landscape and architec-
ture are in progressively lower relief until they are barely
incised rather than carved, an ingenious emulation of the
painter’s technique of atmospheric perspective. This is also
a pioneering example of linear perspective (see “Renais-
sance Perspective” on page 623), in which the orthogonals
converge on the figure of the saint himself. Donatello used
this timely representational system not only to simulate
spatial recession, but also to provide narrative focus.

Donatello, David, c. 1440, bronze, 158 cm (Museo Nazionale de Bargello, Florence) {.text-xs}

<Asterisk />

<!--
- Donatello’s bronze DAVID was the first life-size, free-standing nude since antiquity, Since nothing is known about the circumstances of its creation, this statue has been the subject of continuing inquiry and speculation. Although the representation of David clearly draws on the Classical tradition of heroic nudity, the meaning of this sensuous, pre-pubescent boy in a jaunty, laurel-trimmed shepherd’s hat and boots has long piqued interest. 
- Some art historians have stressed an overt **homoeroticism**, especially in the openly effeminate conception of David and the way a wing from the helmet on Goliath’s severed head brushes the young hero’s inner thigh. Others have seen in David’s angular pose and boyish torso a sense that he is poised between childish interests and adult responsibility, an image of improbable heroism. 
- David was a potent political image in **Florence**, a symbol of the citizens’ resolve to oppose tyrants regardless of their superior power, since virtue brings divine support and preternatural strength, and we will see other Florentine Renaissance renderings of this biblical hero. Indeed, an inscription engraved into the base where the sculpture once stood suggests that it could have celebrated the Florentine triumph over the Milanese in 1425, a victory that brought resolution to a quarter-century struggle with despots and helped give Florence a vision of itself as a strong, virtuous republic. (placed in the courtyard of the medici courtyard, but after medici falln from power, it was moved to the piazza della signoria, town hall square, as a symbol of florence's republican freedom)
- commisioned by Medici family

### Lost-wax casting
- a wax model is encased in a heat-resistant material to create a mold. When heated, the wax melts away, leaving a cavity into which molten metal is poured. Once the metal cools and solidifies, the mold is broken away to reveal the final sculpture.

<!-- 

Probably in 1443, Donatello traveled to Padua to execute one of the first life-size bronze equestrian portraits of the Renaissance—an EQUESTRIAN STATUE  commemorating the Paduan general of the Venetian army, Erasmo da Narni, nicknamed “Gattamelata” (meaning “Honeyed Cat”—a reference to his mother, Melania Gattelli). If any image could be said to characterize the self-made men of the Italian Renaissance, surely it would be those of the condottieri—the brilliant generals such as Gattamelata and Niccolò da Tolentino (SEE FIG. 20–1) who organized the armies and fought for any city-state willing to pay for their services. As guardians for hire, they were tough, opportunistic mercenaries. But they also subscribed to an ideal of military and civic virtue. Horsemanship was more than a necessary skill for the condottieri. The horse, a beast of enormous strength, symbolized animal passions, and skilled horsemanship demonstrated physical and intellectual control—self-control, as well as control of the animal—the triumph of “mind over matter.”

Donatello’s sources for this statue were surviving Roman bronze equestrian portraits, notably the famous image of Marcus Aurelius (SEE FIG. 6–56), which the sculptor certainly knew from his stay in Rome, and the famous set of Roman bronze horses installed on the façade of St. Mark’s Cathedral in Venice. Viewed from a distance, Donatello’s man–animal juggernaut, installed on a high marble base in front of the church of Sant’Antonio in Padua, seems capable of thrusting forward at the first threat. Seen up close, however, the man’s sunken cheeks, sagging jaw, ropy neck, and stern but sad expression suggest a warrior grown old and tired from the constant need for military vigilance and rapid response.

<!-- 


The bronze doors that Lorenzo Ghiberti (1381?–1455) produced for the Florentine Baptistery after winning his famous competition with Brunelleschi in 1401 were such a success that in 1425 he was awarded the commission for yet another set of bronze doors for the east side of the baptistery, facing the doors of the cathedral; his first set of doors was moved to the north side. The new door panels, funded by the wool manufacturers’ guild, were a significant conceptual leap from the older schemes of 28 small scenes employed for Ghiberti’s earlier doors and those of Andrea Pisano in the fourteenth century. Ghiberti departed entirely from the old arrangement, producing a set of ten scenes from the Hebrew Bible—from the Creation to the reign of Solomon—composed in rectangular fields (instead of Gothic trefoils), like a set of framed paintings. Michelangelo reportedly said that the results, installed in 1452, were worthy of the “GATES OF PARADISE”—the name by which they are now commonly known

<!-- 
**Ghiberti's Spatial Organization:**
- Used linear perspective with clear orthogonal lines
- Alternatively used intuitive elements (arches, rocks, trees) to create depth
- Foreground figures placed in lower third of panels
- Figures gradually decrease in size to show depth
- Clear distinction between background and foreground

**Narrative Technique:**
- Combined multiple related events in single frame
- Events separated by narrative time but unified spatially
- Allowed complex storytelling within one pictorial space

**Jacob and Esau Panel (Genesis 25 & 27):**
- Center panel of left door
- Coherent, measurable space with graceful idealized figures
- One-point perspective in architectural setting
- Square pavement tiles create receding orthogonal lines
- Vanishing point located under the loggia
- Towering arches overlap and diminish from foreground to background

**Story Sequence (Background to Foreground):**
- **Upper right rooftop:** Rebecca listens as God warns of her unborn sons' future conflict
- **Under left arch:** Rebecca gives birth to twins
- **Center right:** Adult Esau sells his birthright to Jacob
- **Center right:** Esau goes hunting; Rebecca and Jacob plot against him
- **Right foreground:** Jacob receives Isaac's blessing
- **Center:** Esau faces his father

**Artistic Significance:**
- Relates more closely to contemporary painting than sculpture
- Ghiberti signed the work
- Included self-portrait in medallion at lower right corner
- Demonstrates mastery of perspective and narrative composition

![Sandro Botticelli, Primavera, c. 1482. Tempera on panel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Botticelli-primavera.jpg/3840px-Botticelli-primavera.jpg)

<!--
- Like most artists in the second half of the fifteenth century,
Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi (1445–1510), called
“Botticelli” (“the little barrel,” a nickname borrowed from
his older brother), painted sculptural figures that were
modeled by light from a consistent source and placed in a
setting rendered illusionistic by linear perspective.

**Botticelli's Primavera (c. 1482):**
- Venus at center, surrounded by mythological figures
- Three Graces, Mercury, Cupid
- Lush garden: flowers, trees = spring arrival & renewal

**Narrative:**
- Right side: Zephyrus (west wind) pursues nymph Chloris
- After union, Chloris transforms into Flora (flower goddess)
- Symbolizes nature's springtime blossoming

**Patronage & Symbolism:**
- Embraces pagan mythology
- Oranges = Medici family symbol (Botticelli's patrons)

**Neoplatonism:**
- Meditation on different kinds of beauty
- Three Graces = hierarchy of beauty (physical → spiritual)
- Neoplatonism (3rd c. AD): physical beauty reflects higher spiritual beauty
- Painting explores beauty's relationship to love & desire
- Cosimo de' Medici: patron & Neoplatonism supporter
- Reflects his intellectual interests

<Asterisk />

<!-- 
- **Botticelli's Context:**
    - Outstanding portraitist
    - Included recognizable contemporary figures in religious paintings
    - Worked in Florence for the Medici
    - Called to Rome in 1481 by Pope Sixtus IV to help decorate the Sistine Chapel (with Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and others)

- **Return to Florence & New Phase:**
    - Exposed to philosophical speculations on beauty through humanistic patrons
    - Influenced by examples of ancient art in Medici collections
    - Produced secular paintings of mythological subjects inspired by ancient works and Neoplatonic thought
    - Works patterned on slow movements of fifteenth-century Florentine dance

- **Birth of Venus:**
    - Central image represents Neoplatonic idea of divine love
    - Nude Venus based on antique "modest Venus" statue type (ultimately from Praxiteles's Aphrodite of Knidos)
    - Classical goddess of love and beauty, born of sea foam
    - Averts gaze, arranges hands and hair to hide—but draws attention to—sexuality
    - Arrestingly alluring figure in graceful composition
    - Characteristically decorative use of line
    - Zephyrus (with nymph Chloris) blows Venus ashore on scallop shell
    - Welcomed by devotee offering flower-embroidered garment
    - Painted on canvas (suggests banner or tapestrylike wall hanging)

- **Later Career & Spiritual Crisis:**
    - Affected by profound spiritual crisis
    - Fra Girolamo Savonarola (active 1490–1498) preached against worldliness of Florence
    - Many Florentines reacted with self-recrimination and penitent processions
    - Botticelli may have fallen into religious fervor
    - Burned many earlier paintings in gesture of repentance
    - Began producing highly emotional pictures dominated by intense religiosity
