<!-- 

- The Mongol Empire (1206–1368) was the largest contiguous land empire in history, stretching from Eastern Europe to East Asia. It was founded by Genghis Khan, who united the nomadic tribes of the Mongolian plateau and launched a series of military campaigns that resulted in the conquest of much of Asia and parts of Europe. The Mongol Empire was known for its military prowess, its efficient administration, and its promotion of trade and cultural exchange along the Silk Road. However, it also had a reputation for brutality and destruction, as the Mongols were known for their ruthless tactics in warfare.
- their empire was vast (from  the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea) and diverse, encompassing many different cultures, languages, and religions. The Mongols were known for their tolerance of different cultures and religions, and they often incorporated local customs and traditions into their rule. 
- it was divided into four khanates, each ruled by a different branch of the family. The Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) was the Mongol-ruled dynasty in China, established by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. The Yuan dynasty was marked by significant cultural and economic exchange between China and the rest of the Mongol Empire, as well as by political instability and rebellion. Despite its relatively short duration, the Yuan dynasty had a lasting impact on Chinese history and culture, influencing art, literature, and governance in subsequent dynasties.

</div>

<!-- 

In 1271, the leader of the Mongol empire, Khan (c. 1215–c. 1294), proclaimed the establishment of the Yuan dynasty and declared himself emperor of China, but it was not until 1279 that his conquest of China was completed and the Southern Song dynasty fell. The Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) was the first foreign-ruled dynasty in Chinese history to commandeer all of China. With no experience in the running of such a large and complex empire, the Mongols gradually adopted many Chinese cultural and bureaucratic models.

**separation of China’s political and cultural centers**: The Mongols established their capital in the northern city now known as Beijing. The cultural centers of China, however, remained the great cities of the south, where the Song court had been located for the previous 150 years

### cultural impact
The Mongol invasions were traumatic; their effect on China was long-lasting. During the Song dynasty, China had grown increasingly introspective. Rejecting foreign ideas and influences, intellectuals had focused on defining the qualities that constituted true “Chinese-ness.” They drew a clear distinction between their own people, whom they characterized as gentle, erudite, and sophisticated, and the “barbarians” outside China’s borders, whom they regarded as wild and uncivilized. Now, faced with the reality of foreign occupation, China’s inward gaze intensified in spiritual resistance. For centuries to come, long after the Mongols had gone, leading scholars continued to seek intellectually more challenging, philosophically more profound, and artistically more subtle expressions of all that could be identified as authentically Chinese.

The conditions of Yuan rule now encouraged a clear distinction between court taste, ministered to by professional artists and artisans, and literati taste.

His monumental murals, in excess of thirty-five, adorn the halls of State Bank, Frere Hall Karachi; Lahore Museum; Punjab University; Mangla Dam; Aligarh Muslim University; Banaras Hindu University; Indian Institute of Geological Sciences; Islamic Institute in Delhi, and Abu Dhabi Power House, among others. -
Nor did Yuan rulers have much use for scholars, especially those from the south. The civil service examinations were abolished, and the highest government positions were bestowed, instead, on Mongols and their foreign allies. Scholars now tended to turn inward to search for solutions of their own and try to express themselves in personal and symbolic terms.

Zhao Mengfu (1254–1322) was a descendant of the imperial line of Song. Unlike many scholars of his time, he eventually chose to serve the Yuan government and was made a high official. A distinguished painter, calligrapher,  and poet, Zhao was especially known for his carefully rendered paintings of horses, but he also practiced traditional landscape painting.

### literati painting

- China’s scholar class was unique, the product of an examination system designed to recruit the finest minds in the country for government service.
- the civil service examinations were excruciatingly difficult, but for the tiny percentage who passed at the highest level, the rewards were great—prestige, position, power, and wealth. 
- Steeped in philosophy, literature, and history, China’s scholars—often called wenren (literati)—shared an outlook. Following Confucianism (a philosophy of ethics and social responsibility going back to the  century), they became officials to fulfill their obligation to the world, but pulled by Daoism (a philosophy of harmony with nature and the universe), they retreated from society in order to come to terms with nature and the universe—to create a garden, to write poetry, or to paint.

- In the subsequent Yuan and Ming periods, the tradition of **literati painting** (a style that reflected the taste of the educated class)


- Zhao Mengfu became a prime practitioner of literati painting with his unassuming brushwork, sparing use of color (many literati paintings, like FIG. 25–2,** give up color altogether**), and use of traditional painting to convey personal meaning. 
- The literati did not paHis monumental murals, in excess of thirty-five, adorn the halls of State Bank, Frere Hall Karachi; Lahore Museum; Punjab University; Mangla Dam; Aligarh Muslim University; Banaras Hindu University; Indian Institute of Geological Sciences; Islamic Institute in Delhi, and Abu Dhabi Power House, among others. int for public display but for each other, and Zhao’s Sheep and Goat was actually created at the request of a friend of the artist. The literati favored small formats such as handscrolls, hanging scrolls, or album leaves (book pages), which could easily be shown to friends or shared at small gatherings (see “Formats of Chinese Painting” opposite).  

### sheep and goat
- SHEEP AND GOAT (FIG. 25–2), which he claimed to have drawn from life.
- This may be too simplistic an assessment, because the two animals are portrayed in clearly different styles. The goat, on the right, is carefully described and lifelike in appearance, but the sheep, on the left, is more abstracted, almost flattened. The markings on its body create a sense of pattern rather than the appearance of natural irregularities. Some have seen pride in the sheep’s posture and submission in the pose of the goat—although with head down, the goat could also be prepared to attack. Some have proposed that Zhao was expressing either acceptance of or resistance to the rule of the foreign Yuan dynasty, or since the same Chinese word is used for these two animals, perhaps he implies that the Mongols and the Chinese are not as different as they seem.

In a sense, he was creating historical art. In doing so, he opened the way not only for the next generation of Yuan amateur (or literati) painters—notably the Four Great Masters of the Yuan, which included Huang Gongwang (1269–1354), Ni Zan (1301–1374), Wu Zhen (1280–1354), and Wang Meng (1308–1385)—but also for all subsequent scholar-amateur style landscape painting until today.

Another favored painting genre of the Yuan is bamboo painting (for example, a painting by Ni Zan). To the proud and secluded Yuan scholars, bamboo itself was a symbol of the true gentleman (it bends but does not break in a wind, returning upright), much like the scholar who maintains their integrity no matter how adverse the circumstance is.

Ni Zan’s eccentric behavior became legendary in the history of Chinese art. In his early years he was one of the richest men in the region, the owner of a large estate. His pride and his aloofness from daily affairs often got him into trouble with the authorities. His cleanliness was notorious. In addition to washing himself several times daily, he ordered his servants to wash the trees in his garden and to clean the furniture after his guests had left. He was said to be so unworldly that late in life he gave away most of his possessions and lived as a hermit in a boat, wandering on rivers and lakes.

Literati painting was associated with a viewpoint concerning what constituted an appropriate life. The ideal, as embodied by Ni Zan and others, was a brilliantly gifted scholar whose spirit was too refined for the dusty world of government service and who thus preferred to live as a recluse or had retired after having become frustrated by a brief stint as an official.

#### blue-and-white porcelain ✏️
</div>

<!-- 

 the widespread introduction of blue-and-white decorated porcelain, as well as innovations in lacquer manufacture, were crucial developments that affected the arts of the subsequent Ming and Qing dynasties.

 the porclain is a special type of ceramic ware that is made from a particular kind of clay called kaolin, which is fired at very high temperatures to create a hard, white, and translucent material. Porcelain was first developed in China during the Tang dynasty (618–907) and reached its peak during the Song dynasty (960–1279). During the Yuan dynasty, porcelain production continued to flourish, and new techniques were developed that allowed for more intricate designs and decorations.

 When Marco Polo visited China he was impressed by the outer shell and the word “porcelain” is derived from the Italian word for the cowrie shell, which was used as a form of currency in ancient China and was often depicted in early Chinese ceramics. The term “china” is also used to refer to porcelain, and it is believed to have originated from the Persian word for China, which was “Chin.”

 Porcelain ceramics painted with cobalt oxide (which turns blue) before being coated with a clear glaze came to be known as blue-and-white porcelain and began to be widely produced in Jingdezhen in south China for domestic consumption and for trade, especially to the Near East. The Yuan court established some regulatory control at Jingdezhen, which became the most important center of porcelain manufacture in China.

- An example of blue-and-white porcelain, the David Vases are decorated with a design of two dragons chasing a flaming pearl, a common motif in Chinese art. The dragons are depicted in a style that is characteristic of the Yuan dynasty, with sinuous bodies and sharp claws.

At the same time, they became associated with superior beings such as virtuous rulers and sages.

Dragon sightings were duly recorded and considered auspicious. Yet even the Son of Heaven could not monopolize the dragon. During the Tang and Song dynasties the practice arose of painting pictures of dragons to pray for rain, and for Chan (Zen) Buddhists, the dragon was a symbol of sudden enlightenment.

### Iconography:
Bhaishajyaguru (A), the Buddha of Medicine, sits on a lotus throne surrounded by an assembly of deities. Standing to either side of the central figure are the Buddha’s attendant bodhisattvas: Candraprabha (B), or Yueguang Pusa 月光菩薩, and Suryaprabha (C), or Riguang Pusa 日光菩薩. They can be identified by the adjacent white moon and the red sun, respectively. Two larger bodhisattvas are seated to the right and left of the smaller standing figures. Two secondary bodhisattvas at lower left and lower right carry a monk’s staff and medicine bowl (D and E), Bhaishajyaguru’s traditional attributes. The Twelve Guardian Generals (F) are depicted at the two sides of the mural. They personify Bhaishajyaguru’s vow to help all in need by curing illness, ensuring the birth of healthy children, and providing clothing and other necessities.


### Wall painting 
This is from the east gable of the Guangcheng Lower Temple in Shanxi Province. This temple was rediscovered in the 1930s because a full set of Buddhist scriptures, known as sutras, was found at this temple complex, and it put this monastery on the map.

This painting was originally paired with an equally large image of Tejaprabha, the Buddha of Blazing Light, who controls the planets and constellations and, therefore, one’s fate. He is believed to bring good fortune and long life. The pairing of Bhaishajyaguru and Tejaprabha is unusual and may illustrate concerns fostered by the devastating earthquake and fire that destroyed the Guangsheng monastery complex in 1303.

This representation of the Buddha of Medicine once adorned the east wall of the main hall in the Lower Guangsheng (“Vast
Triumph”) Temple, in the northern Chinese province of Shanxi. Rebuilt after an earthquake in 1303, the temple’s eastern compound is constructed along a north-south axis. The large entry gate leads into the front and main halls, which are connected by covered
walkways. Used for assemblies and lectures, the main hall once contained paintings on its east, north, and west walls, as well as
numerous freestanding wooden sculptures of Buddhist deities. Records indicate that the hall was rebuilt and refurbished between
1303 and 1319.

Buddha relinquished all worldly possessions and attachments to achieve enlightenment, but he is often depicted with a variety of attributes that symbolize his teachings and the path to enlightenment. The most common attributes include

samsara (the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth), the lotus flower (symbolizing purity and enlightenment), the wheel of dharma (representing the teachings of the Buddha), and the mudra (hand gestures that convey specific meanings). In this mural, the Buddha of Medicine is depicted with a medicine bowl, which symbolizes his role as a healer and his ability to cure both physical and spiritual ailments. 

### Buddhas
Budhashakyamuni, the historical Buddha, is often depicted with a serene expression and a calm demeanor, reflecting his enlightenment and inner peace. In this mural, the Buddha of Medicine is shown with a gentle smile and a peaceful expression, conveying his compassion and benevolence towards all beings.

Mahayāna Buddhism, which was the dominant form of Buddhism in China during the Yuan dynasty, emphasizes the importance of compassion and the idea of the bodhisattva, a being who has achieved enlightenment but chooses to remain in the world to help others achieve enlightenment as well. The Buddha of Medicine is often depicted as a bodhisattva, embodying the ideal of compassion and selflessness that is central to Mahayana Buddhism.

#### Technique and Style:
This mural was painted on a ground of dry plaster mixed with straw and covered with clay. Thick black outlines define the images, which are filled in using vegetable and mineral pigments. Only the latter—predominantly red, green, and white—have survived. This is one of several murals from the Fen River area, in southern Shanxi province that are associated with the workshop of the early fourteenth-century master craftsman Zhu Haogu. A robust figure type with a full face and shallow spatial constrictions typify the style, found in both Buddhist and Daoist temple art.

<!-- 

The founder of the next dynasty, the Ming (1368–1644), came from a family of poor, uneducated peasants. As Zhu Yuanzhang rose through the ranks in the army, he enlisted the help of scholars to gain power and solidify his following. Once he had driven the Mongols from Beijing and firmly established himself as emperor, however, he grew to distrust intellectuals. His rule was despotic, even ruthless. Throughout the nearly 300 years of Ming rule, most emperors shared his attitude, so although the civil service examinations were reinstated, scholars remained alienated from the government they were trained to serve.

- During Yuan rule porcelain production was for domentic market. 
- During the reigns of the Yongle (1403–1424) and Xuande (1426–1435) emperors, major trade and diplomatic missions traveled to the Middle East, and Ming porcelain made its way to Turkey and Iran, where its refined decoration and flawless glazing was admired
- the shape of two porcelain flasks used for decanting wine in the Chinese imperial household (FIG. 25–4) were probably inspired by Islamic glass vessels brought back to China with traders returning from these missions.

<!-- 
The contrast between the luxurious world of the court and the austere ideals of the literati continued through the Ming dynasty. A typical example of Ming court taste is HUNDREDS OF BIRDS ADMIRING THE PEACOCKS (FIG. 25–5), a large painting on silk by Yin Hong, an artist active during the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. A pupil of well-known courtiers, Yin probably served in the court at Beijing. This painting is an example of the birds-andflowers genre, which had been popular with artists of the Song academy. Here the subject takes on symbolic meaning, with the homage of the birds to the peacocks representing the homage of court officials to the imperial state. Although the style is faithful to Song academic models, the large format and intense attention to detail are traits of the Ming.

A preeminent professional painter in the Ming period was Qiu Ying (1494–1552), who lived in Suzhou, a prosperous southern city. He inspired generations of imitators with exceptional works such as a long handscroll known as SPRING DAWN IN THE HAN PALACE. The painting is based on Tang-dynasty depictions of women in the court of the Han dynasty (206 bce220 ce). While in the service of a well-known collector, Qiu Ying had the opportunity to study many Tang paintings, whose artists usually concentrated on figures set on blank backgrounds. Qiu’s graceful and elegant figuresalthough modeled after those in Tang works—are situated  within a carefully described setting of palace buildings. They engage in courtly pastimes, such as chess, music, calligraphy, and painting. With its antique subject matter, refined technique, brilliant color, and controlled composition, Spring Dawn in the Han Palace brought professional painting to another level

-  Mount Hua is in Shaanxi province. Shaanxi province is a little bit to the north. The mountain itself is known for being this treacherous vertical form, very otherworldly. 
-   Look at the way in which he’s used brushstrokes to define the verticality of that mountain. Those huge faces of rock that seem to jut skyward, to create this otherworldly space that has a deeply spiritual dimension. You can see the contour lines. First, these very rich, fluid lines demarcating the boulders, and then you’ve got these texture strips that give a sense of the roughness of each peak, and then little bits of moss dripping over the sides. Then you’ve also got softer washes of ink, especially in the peaks in the distance. On top of all of it, you’ve got these very dense strokes, these layers upon layers of little, tiny brushstrokes; very fluid, rich black ink of the pine trees. 
-   This is a Taoist (or Daoist) idea, that the mountain was inhabited by the Immortals, perfected beings. Although that’s not explicitly referenced here, it does exist subtly in the background. 
-   They’re specific scenes. Each of them pictures a particular place in the mountain, a particular moment in time that the artist then inscribed, explaining exactly when he visited this place and what those conditions might have been. So these are really personal memories. These are explorations of moments that he remembers from his encounter with this landscape.

<!-- 

One of the major literati painters from the Ming period is Shen Zhou (1427–1509), who had no desire to enter government service and spent most of his life in Suzhou (in the south ). He studied the Yuan painters avidly and tried to recapture their spirit in such works as Poet on a Mountaintop (see “Poet on a Mountaintop” opposite). Although the style of the painting recalls the freedom and simplicity of Ni Zan (SEE FIG. 25–3), the motif of a poet surveying the landscape from a mountain plateau is Shen’s creation.

In earlier landscape paintings, human figures were typically shown dwarfed by the grandeur of nature. Travelers might be seen scuttling along a narrow path by a stream, while overhead towered mountains whose peaks were in the clouds and whose heights were inaccessible. But in FIGURE 25–9 the poet has climbed the mountain and dominates the landscape. Even the clouds are beneath him. Before his gaze, a poem hangs in the air, as though he were projecting his thoughts

<!-- 

Centuries of warfare and destruction have left very few early Chinese architectural monuments intact. The most important remaining example of traditional architecture is THE FORBIDDEN CITY, the imperial palace compound in Beijing, whose principal buildings were constructed during the Ming dynasty

Beijing was developed as a walled, rectangular city with streets laid out in a grid. The palace enclosure occupied the center of the northern part of the city, which was reserved for the Mongols. Chinese lived in the southern third of the city. Later, Ming and Qing emperors preserved this division, with officials living in the northern or Inner City and commoners living in the southern or Outer City. The third Ming emperor, Yongle (ruled 1403–1424), rebuilt the Forbidden City as we see it today.

The approach was impressive. Visitors entered through the Meridian Gate, a monumental complex with perpendicular side wings (in the center of FIG. 25–8). Next they encountered a broad courtyard crossed by a bow-shaped  waterway spanned by five arched marble bridges. At the opposite end of this courtyard is the Gate of Supreme Harmony, opening onto an even larger courtyard that houses three ceremonial halls raised on a broad platform. First is the Hall of Supreme Harmony, where on the most important state occasions the emperor sat on his throne, facing south. Beyond is the smaller Hall of Central Harmony, then the Hall of Protecting Harmony. Behind these vast ceremonial spaces, still on the central axis, is the inner court, again with a progression of three buildings, this time more intimate in scale. In its balance and symmetry the plan of the Forbidden City reflects ancient Chinese beliefs about the harmony of the universe, and it emphasizes the emperor’s role as the Son of Heaven, maintaining the cosmic order from his throne in the middle of the world.

In 1644, when the armies of the Manchu people northeast of China marched into Beijing, many Chinese reacted as though their civilization had come to an end. Yet the Manchus had already adopted many Chinese customs and institutions. After gaining control of all of China, a process that took decades, they showed great respect for Chinese tradition. All the major artistic trends of the late Ming dynasty eventually continued into the Manchu, or Qing, dynasty (1644–1911).

Literati painting had been established as the dominant tradition; it now became orthodox. Scholars followed Dong Qichang’s recommendation, basing their approach on the study of past masters—especially Song and Yuan artistsand imitating antique styles as a way of expressing their own learning, technique, and taste. The Qing emperors of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were painters themselves.

Wang Shimin was one of several artists who was active in the south, in this area called Jiangnan, or south of the Yangtze River. That is a place that was a little farther from the court in Beijing that had a scholarly literati culture established through several of the major cities, Nanjing, Suzhou included.

Wang Shimin painted among other artists, wrote poetry among his friends. They shared these works amongst each other and they were interested in studying that brushwork of the past.

### Landscape painting

Landscape paintings as a genre developed in the Five Dynasties period. We see the emergence of landscape painting as its own genre, not just a setting for narrative or a background for events, but something that is taken as a subject in its own right.

600 years later, in the Qing dynasty, landscape painting is still the dominant genre.

That’s what Wang Shimin is doing here. He’s interested in the theories, the principles, the brushwork, the composition, the elements that make for landscape painting.

Instead of the earlier landscape painters who are immersing themselves in nature and responding emotionally to nature, he’s studying art and making his painting about that art. (Like Mannerism)

### importance of literati painting

Throughout most of Chinese history, the imperial court had set the tone for artistic taste: Artisans attached to the court produced architecture, paintings, gardens, and objects of jade, lacquer, ceramics, and silk especially for imperial use. Over the centuries, painters and calligraphers gradually moved higher up the social scale, for these “arts of the brush” were often practiced by scholars and even emperors, whose high status reflected positively on whatever interested them. With the establishment of an imperial painting academy during the Song dynasty, painters finally achieved a status equal to that of court officials. For the literati, painting came to be grouped with calligraphy and poetry as the trio of accomplishments suited to members of the cultural elite. But while the literati elevated the status of painting by virtue of practicing it, they also began to develop their own  ideas of what painting should be. Not needing to earn an income from their art, they cultivated an amateur ideal in which personal expression counted for more than professional skill. They created for themselves a status as artists totally separate from and superior to professional painters, whose art they felt was inherently compromised, since it was done to please others and tainted by money.

## Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) in Korea

<!-- 

### Joseon dynasty

The Joseon, or Yi dynasty, was founded in 1392 by the military leader Yi Song-gye and lasted until 1910. It was the last imperial dynasty and the longest in the history of Korea.

In 1392, General Yi Seonggye (1335–1408) overthrew the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392), establishing the Joseon dynasty (1392–1910), sometimes called the Yi dynasty. He first maintained his capital at Gaeseong, the old Goryeo capital, but moved it to Seoul in 1394, where it remained through the end of the dynasty. The Joseon regime rejected Buddhism, espousing Neo-Confucianism as the state  philosophy. Taking Ming-dynasty China as its model, the new government patterned its bureaucracy on that of the Ming emperors, even adopting as its own such outward symbols of Ming imperial authority as blue-and-white porcelain. The early Joseon era was a period of cultural refinement and scientific achievement during which Koreans invented Han’geul (the Korean alphabet) and movable type, not to mention the rain gauge, astrolabe, celestial globe, sundial, and water clock.

- Buncheong ware: light gray stoneware with decoration painted in iron-brown slip on a white slip ground

Descended from Goryeo celadons, Joseon-dynasty stonewares, known as buncheong wares, enjoyed widespread usage throughout the peninsula. Their decorative effect relies on the use of white slip that makes the humble stoneware resemble more expensive white porcelain. In fifteenth-century examples, the slip is often seen inlaid into repeating design elements stamped into the clay body. Sixteenth-century buncheong wares are characteristically embellished with wonderfully fluid, calligraphic brushwork painted in iron-brown slip on a white slip ground. Most painted buncheong wares have stylized floral décor, but rare pieces, such as a charming WINE BOTTLE (FIG. 25–17), feature pictorial decoration. In fresh, lively brushstrokes, a bird with outstretched wings grasps a fish that it has just caught in its talons; waves roll below, while two giant lotus blossoms frame the scene.

In the eighteenth century, a truly Korean style emerged, inspired by the silhak (“practical learning”) movement, which emphasized the study of things Korean in addition to the Chinese classics. The impact of the movement is exemplified by the painter Jeong Seon (1676–1759), who chose well-known Korean vistas as the subjects of his paintings, rather than the Chinese themes favored by earlier artists.

Other artists expanded the growing interest in Korean themes to different sorts of subject matter. Kim Hongdo (1745–1806) painted genre scenes that showcased the everyday lives and occupations not of the nobility, but of commoners.

### Kim Hongdo, album of genre paintings

Album of Genre Paintings by Kim Hongdo contains twenty-five paintings of everyday life during the Joseon era
series of 25 album leaves portraying genre scenes

Album of Genre Paintings by Kim Hongdo contains twenty-five paintings of everyday life during the Joseon era: Tiling a Roof, Tavern, Lunch, Plowing, Blacksmith’s Workshop, Threshing Rice, Shoeing a Horse, Cutting Tobacco, Weaving a Straw Mat, Weaving and Spinning, Dancing Boy, Wrestling, Fortunetelling, Yunnori (Traditional Board Game), Village School, Admiring a Painting, Shooting Arrows, Bridegroom’s Trip to the Bride, Peddling, Ferryboats, At the Well, Fishing, Street Encounter, Merchants Going Home, and Washing Place. Painted by Kim Hongdo, the most renowned and beloved artist of his time, these iconic paintings are now among the most familiar images produced during the Joseon period.

#### Compositions

To depict such diverse scenes, Kim Hongdo used a variety of different compositions to creatively organize the space in his works. In particular, a number of the works from Album of Genre Paintings by Kim Hongdo are characterized by circular composition, including A Dancing Boy (below), Wrestling, Village School, and Admiring a Painting. Although many Joseon paintings feature images of people sitting in a circle, it is quite rare to find an entire painting that is organized with a circular composition. Along with the three aforementioned paintings, all of which plainly depict a gathering of people sitting in a circle, Wrestling  (shown earlier) has a more complex and dynamic circular arrangement, with numerous people (the most figures of any work in the album) facing in different directions.

Since his works often have no other details, Kim tended to rely on unorthodox compositions and arrangements of people to enhance the vitality of his scenes. For example, in addition to circular compositions, he sometimes placed people along diagonals, in an “X” shape, or in a trapezoid. These distinct compositions can serve to draw the viewers’ eye to either the center or the edge of the painting, depending on the motif. Thus, the arrangements enliven the scenes with a subtle energy.
