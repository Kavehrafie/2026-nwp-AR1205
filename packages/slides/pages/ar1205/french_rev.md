![Women forced under starvation of family and violent inner feeling take to the streets of Versailles in hopes of capturing bread.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/A_Versailles%2C_%C3%A0_Versailles_5_octobre_1789_-_Restoration.jpg/3840px-A_Versailles%2C_%C3%A0_Versailles_5_octobre_1789_-_Restoration.jpg)

<!-- 

the French revolution began by the protests for the bread and women were the first to take to the streets of Versailles in hopes of capturing bread. The revolution was a period of radical social and political change in France that lasted from 1789 to 1799. It was characterized by the overthrow of the monarchy, the establishment of a republic, and the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. The revolution was driven by a combination of economic, social, and political factors, including widespread poverty, inequality, and dissatisfaction with the ruling class. The revolution had a profound impact on French society and politics, and it also influenced other revolutionary movements around the world.
