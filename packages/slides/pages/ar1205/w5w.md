- The Aztec Empire was a powerful Mesoamerican civilization that flourished in central Mexico from the 14th to the 16th century. It was centered around the city of Tenochtitlan, which is now Mexico City. The empire was known for its complex social structure, impressive architecture, and rich cultural traditions. The Aztecs were skilled warriors and traders, and they built a vast network of alliances and tributary states. However, their empire came to an end with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés in 1519, which ultimately led to the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1521.
- The Aztecs were known for their impressive architecture, including the construction of temples, pyramids, and palaces. One of the most famous structures is the Templo Mayor, a large pyramid located in the heart of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs also built causeways and canals to connect their city to the surrounding areas, showcasing their advanced engineering skills. Their architecture often featured intricate carvings and sculptures that depicted their religious beliefs and cultural practices.

- Tenochtitlan was the capital city of the Aztec Empire, located on an island in Lake Texcoco. It was founded in 1325 and became one of the largest cities in the world at its peak, with a population of around 200,000 people. The city was known for its impressive architecture, including the Templo Mayor, a large pyramid dedicated to the Aztec gods. Tenochtitlan was also a major center of trade and culture, with bustling markets and vibrant artistic traditions. However, it was ultimately conquered by Spanish forces led by Hernán Cortés in 1521, leading to the fall of the Aztec Empire.
- Lake Texcoco was a large lake in the Valley of Mexico, where the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan was located. The lake played a crucial role in the development of the Aztec civilization, providing water for agriculture and transportation. The Aztecs built their city on an island in the lake, using a system of canals and causeways to connect it to the mainland. However, over time, the lake was drained and filled in, leading to significant environmental changes in the region. Today, much of the area that was once Lake Texcoco is now part of Mexico City.

When we saw so many cities and villages built 
on the water and other great towns on dry land and that 
straight and level causeway going towards [Tenochtitlan], 
we were amazed … on account of the great towers and 
temples and buildings rising from the water, and all built 
of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether 
the things that we saw were not a dream. 

<!-- 
- in november 1519, the army of the Spanish soldiers Hernan Cortes saw for the first time the great Aztec capital
- One of Cortes;s companion later recalled the wonder.

-In 1502 Montezuma succeeded his uncle Ahuitzotl as the leader of an empire that had reached its greatest extent, stretching to what is now Honduras and Nicaragua, but that was weakened by the resentment of the subject tribes to the increasing demands for tribute and victims for the religious sacrifices.
- The painting depicts the historic encounter between Hernán Cortés, the Spanish conquistador, and Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor. This meeting took place in 1519 when Cortés arrived in Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The painting captures the moment of their first interaction, which was marked by a mix of curiosity, tension, and cultural exchange. 
- malinchōtl, also known as La Malinche, was a native woman who played a crucial role in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. She served as an interpreter, advisor, and intermediary for Hernán Cortés, helping him communicate with the indigenous peoples of Mexico. Malinchōtl's knowledge of both the Nahuatl language and Spanish made her an invaluable asset to Cortés during his campaign. However, her legacy is complex, as she is often viewed as a traitor by some for her collaboration with the Spanish, while others see her as a victim of circumstance who navigated a difficult situation to survive.

<!-- 
- writing is a system of communication that uses symbols to represent language. It allows us to record and transmit information across time and space. The earliest known writing systems date back to around 3100–3000 B.C.E, with the development of cuneiform in Mesopotamia and hieroglyphs in Egypt. These early writing systems were used for various purposes, including recording economic transactions, religious texts, and historical events. Writing has played a crucial role in the development of human civilization, enabling us to preserve knowledge, share ideas, and create complex societies.

The act of conquest, for example, is represented in both the Mixtec Codex Selden and the
Aztec Codex Mendoza by a warrior grasping her or his
foe by the hair (Fig. 3ab).9 In the Codex Selden it is
the ruler Lady 6 Monkey, who is identified by her day
name, 6 Monkey, attached to her by a line. In the
Codex Mendoza it is an unnamed warrior, whose identity is established by his short quilted cotton armor and
his hairstyle of a warrior’s topknot.

<!-- 
- The Codex Mendoza is a 16th-century Aztec codex created shortly after the Spanish conquest of Mexico. It was commissioned by the Spanish viceroy Antonio de Mendoza and is named after him. The codex contains a wealth of information about Aztec society, culture, and history, including details about the founding of Tenochtitlan, the capital city of the Aztec Empire. The page depicting the founding of Tenochtitlan shows the Aztecs arriving at the site where they would build their city, guided by an eagle perched on a cactus, which was a significant symbol in Aztec mythology. The codex is an important historical document that provides insight into the Aztec civilization and its interactions with the Spanish conquistadors.
