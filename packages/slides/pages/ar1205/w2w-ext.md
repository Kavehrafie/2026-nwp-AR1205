inwardness or subjectvity
"melancholy": condition where the self is turned inward upon itself, becomes absorned in, and parlyzed by, its own thoughts

Melancholia, being  one of humors, bile so to speak,  was believed to affect the mind and body. In particular, it was associated with intellectuals and artists, who were thought to be more prone to bouts of melancholy (creativity and melancholy were often linked in German Renaissance thought). "This creativity, more abstract and speculative than manual labor, elevates artists to a status akin to God's.... Where the Middle Ages substantialized inwardness as the excess of black bile and moralized that excess as the deadly sin of acedia, the Renaissance abstracted inwardness as an inherent quality of creative genius and valorized its effects in the originality of the artist, whose works are wholly his own." (Koerner, 26)
