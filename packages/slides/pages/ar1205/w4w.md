<!-- 
In the court of Shah Suleiman I, the Safavid ruler of Iran, we see a scene of cultural exchange and global trade. The presence of European-style clothing and the depiction of foreign visitors suggest the influence of global trade routes and interactions with European powers during the 17th century.

Dejima (Japanese: 出島; lit. 'exit island') or Deshima,[a] in the 17th century also called Tsukishima (築島; lit. 'built island'), was an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan, that served as a trading post for the Portuguese (1570–1639) and subsequently the Dutch (1641–1858).[1] For 220 years, it was the central conduit for foreign trade and cultural exchange with Japan during the isolationist Edo period (1600–1869), and the only Japanese territory open to Westerners

- the dutch were the only westerners allowed to trade with Japan during the Edo period, and they were confined to Dejima, an artificial island in Nagasaki harbor. This limited contact allowed for a unique cultural exchange, where Dutch goods and knowledge influenced Japanese art, science, and technology, while Japanese culture also left its mark on Dutch art and fashion.

- the dutch are recognizable in the painting by their distinctive clothing, which includes wide-brimmed hats, doublets, and breeches. The presence of these foreign figures in the Safavid court highlights the interconnectedness of global trade networks during the 17th century and the cultural exchanges that occurred as a result of these interactions.

### Landscape Painting ✏️ as Mapping the World

<br>

### The word "landscape" entered the modern English language as _landskip_ (variously _spelt_), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works ofart, with its first use as a word for a painting in 1598.

<!-- Landscape painting in the Baroque period often served as a way to map and represent the world, reflecting the expanding horizons of European exploration and colonization. Artists like Jacob van Ruisdael and Aelbert Cuyp depicted vast, detailed landscapes that not only showcased the beauty of nature but also symbolized the growing knowledge and control over the environment. These paintings often included elements such as ships, exotic flora and fauna, and distant horizons, which conveyed a sense of discovery and the global reach of European powers during this era. -->

### Still-Life Painting ✏️, Trade Routes, and Cultural Exchange in the Baroque Period

<!-- 

These included:

the India Run (the voyage made by the Portuguese between Lisbon and Goa, on the southwestern coast of India. from the 16th to the 19th centuries)
the Manila Galleon (maintained by Spain between 1565–1815 to bring Asian goods—including the Japanese lacquer works that Mexican artists embraced in enconchado paintings such as the one mentioned above—across the North Pacific from Manila in the Philippines to Acapulco in New Spain, now Mexico),
and the Dutch East and West India Companies (VOC and GWC), which monopolized trade with Eurasia and Southern Africa and with West Africa and the Americas, respectively, during much of the 17th and 18th centuries.
These routes and companies moved exotic luxury objects such as Indian and Chinese fabrics, lacquer furniture, ivory figurines, porcelain, and spices across all the known continents. But most were also involved in the slave trade, adding a brutal aspect to this early modern globalization in the thousands of Africans who were forced into slavery in Europe and the Americas.

## Willem Kalf (1619–1693)
Kalf was a student of Hendrik Pot, a painter of historical subjects, and probably also of the painter Cornelis Saftleven. His choice of still lifes as subject matter dates to a stay in Paris (late 1630s–1646). His early works depict kitchen interiors with such elements as gourds and pots and pans strewn on the floor. These early paintings are much different in character from his later, luxurious compositions featuring such expensive and extraordinary objects as goblets, pewter, Venetian glass, and Chinese porcelain atop a marble or tapestry-covered table. Though his still lifes followed an established formula, Kalf greatly enriched the genre with his use of simple composition, dark background, and acutely perceived highlights. In restraint and richness of texture, Kalf’s still lifes were seldom, if ever, matched.

The wealthy inhabitants of Amsterdam found Kalf’s work irresistible. His banquet pieces and lavish representations of fine objects were in great demand.

### paintin: A Review of the Global Baroqueg
The wealth of materials, techniques, and especially the countless artists, artisans, and craftsmen of various origins who contributed to the creation of this global Baroque can’t be overestimated. Think about how the desire for Chinese porcelain in the Dutch Republic drove the production of delftware (illustrated earlier), a domestic version of the coveted ware (and in turn how the Chinese created new types of ceramics for European markets), or how the “perfect red” attained with American cochineal dye became the color of royalty and nobility across Europe and the Americas.

### still life painting
Still-life painting emerged as a major genre in the Baroque period, particularly in the Dutch Republic, where artists like Pieter Claesz and Willem Kalf created intricate compositions featuring everyday objects, food, and luxury items. These paintings often carried symbolic meanings related to the transience of life (vanitas themes) and the wealth generated through global trade.

![Juan Sánchez Cotán, Still Life with Quince, Cabbage, Melon, and Cucumber, c. 1602, oil on canvas](https://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cotan-EDITED.jpg)


<!-- 

Juan Sánchez Cotán’s Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber combines the hyper-realistic depiction of fruits and vegetables with the theatricality of staging these objects under dramatic lighting against a dark background, as well as an erudite classical reference: like most Baroque still life painters, Cotán was probably emulating the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis, who was known through written accounts for the deceptively illusionistic powers of his paintings.

The aim of Dutch painters was to capture on a surface a great range of knowledge and information about the world. ,,, Like the mapper, they made additive works that could not be taken in from a single viewing point.

- painting in painting
- the lady in blue is Clio, the muse of history, who holds a trumpet and a book, symbols of fame and knowledge. The map on the back wall is a map of the Netherlands, which was a common motif in Dutch Golden Age paintings and often symbolized national pride and identity.
- Look at the curtain that’s been drawn back, that takes up the top quarter of the painting. We’re looking at a scene that we don’t normally get to see.
-  Look at the artist. He’s dressed up too. He’s dressed up the model, but he’s wearing something fancier than the artist would traditionally wear in the studio. This black vest that has these openings and slits in it, and this really nice hat. The bright orange leggings.
-  in the 18th cent, Vermeer was felt off fashion and his work was not widely known. But in the 19th century, he was rediscovered by art critics and collectors, and his paintings became highly sought after. Today, Vermeer is considered one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age, and his works are celebrated for their exquisite detail, use of light, and ability to capture the quiet beauty of everyday life.
-  hitler bought the painting in 1940, and it was displayed in the Führermuseum in Linz, Austria. After World War II, the painting was recovered by the Allies and returned to the Netherlands. It is now housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria.

### Camera Obscura
It was a device that projected an image of the outside world onto a surface inside a darkened room or box. It was used by artists like Vermeer to achieve accurate perspective and lighting in their paintings. The camera obscura allowed artists to trace the projected image, helping them to create more realistic and detailed works of art.
