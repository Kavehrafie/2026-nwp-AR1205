![17th-century Dutch Dejima, Japan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/DutchDejima.png)

<!-- 
In the court of Shah Suleiman I, the Safavid ruler of Iran, we see a scene of cultural exchange and global trade. The presence of European-style clothing and the depiction of foreign visitors suggest the influence of global trade routes and interactions with European powers during the 17th century.

Dejima (Japanese: 出島; lit. 'exit island') or Deshima,[a] in the 17th century also called Tsukishima (築島; lit. 'built island'), was an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan, that served as a trading post for the Portuguese (1570–1639) and subsequently the Dutch (1641–1858).[1] For 220 years, it was the central conduit for foreign trade and cultural exchange with Japan during the isolationist Edo period (1600–1869), and the only Japanese territory open to Westerners

- the dutch were the only westerners allowed to trade with Japan during the Edo period, and they were confined to Dejima, an artificial island in Nagasaki harbor. This limited contact allowed for a unique cultural exchange, where Dutch goods and knowledge influenced Japanese art, science, and technology, while Japanese culture also left its mark on Dutch art and fashion.

- the dutch are recognizable in the painting by their distinctive clothing, which includes wide-brimmed hats, doublets, and breeches. The presence of these foreign figures in the Safavid court highlights the interconnectedness of global trade networks during the 17th century and the cultural exchanges that occurred as a result of these interactions.

### Landscape Painting ✏️ as Mapping the World

<br>

### The word "landscape" entered the modern English language as _landskip_ (variously _spelt_), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works ofart, with its first use as a word for a painting in 1598.

<!-- Landscape painting in the Baroque period often served as a way to map and represent the world, reflecting the expanding horizons of European exploration and colonization. Artists like Jacob van Ruisdael and Aelbert Cuyp depicted vast, detailed landscapes that not only showcased the beauty of nature but also symbolized the growing knowledge and control over the environment. These paintings often included elements such as ships, exotic flora and fauna, and distant horizons, which conveyed a sense of discovery and the global reach of European powers during this era. -->

<!-- 

- Andries Beeckman's The Castle of Batavia depicts the Dutch colonial presence in Indonesia, showcasing the architecture and bustling activity of the port city. The painting serves as a visual record of Dutch imperialism and the global trade networks that connected Europe to Asia during the 17th century.

### Franz Post
From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch colony in northern Brazil, appropriated from the Portuguese, forcibly dispossessed Indigenous populations of their land. Post and a naturalist accompanied the governor to the area and recorded flora and fauna (such as the foreground iguana). The landscapes he produced after returning home mix observation with fantasy. Post’s painting hides the process by which natural resources were obtained. Absent are obvious references to the enslavement of African people and their forced labor on plantations, the basis of Dutch colonial wealth. Indigenous families appear at rest, apparently after hunting and food gathering. Routinely treated as generic figures in Dutch representations, Indigenous Brazilian groups include the Aymoré, Potiguara, Tarairiu, and Tupinambá, among others.

<!-- 


Portuguese traders had first introduced sugarcane to the Americas in the 1500s. Portugal had pioneered the plantation system in the Atlantic islands of Madeira and São Tomé, and because the sugar produced from Brazilian plantations was used for an export market, this necessitated land that could be acquired with little conflict from existing occupants. By the sixteenth century, sugarcane plantations had been developed along the northeast coast of Brazil, and the sugar produced from these plantations became the basis of the Brazilian economy and society. By 1570, Brazil's sugar output rivaled that of the Atlantic islands.

At first, the settlers tried to enslave the native peoples to work the sugarcane fields, but this proved to be difficult, so they turned to using slaves instead. Slave labor was the driving force behind the growth of the sugar economy in Brazil, and sugar was the primary export of the colony from 1600 to 1650.

In the mid-seventeenth century, the Dutch seized productive areas of northeast Brazil, and because the Dutch were expelled from Brazil, following a strong push by Portuguese-Brazilians and their indigenous and Afro-Brazilian allies, Dutch sugar production became the model for Brazilian sugar production in the Caribbean. Increased production and competition meant that the price of sugar dropped, and Brazil's market share dropped. However, Brazil's recovery from the Dutch incursion was slow, as warfare had taken its toll on the sugar plantations.

<!--
- Jacob van Ruisdael's View of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds depicts the Dutch landscape and the process of bleaching linen, which was an important industry in the Netherlands. The painting reflects the economic prosperity of the Dutch Golden Age and the connection between art and commerce during this period.
- The painting also serves as a metaphor for the Dutch Republic's global reach and influence, as the bleaching grounds can be seen as a symbol of the country's ability to transform raw materials into valuable commodities through trade and industry. The expansive sky and distant horizon in the painting evoke a sense of openness and possibility, mirroring the opportunities presented by global trade and exploration during the 17th century.
- Compared to the other European nations, the Dutch peseats were relatively wealthy, and the country had a high standard of living. This economic prosperity was largely due to the success of Dutch trade and commerce, which allowed for a flourishing art market and the patronage of artists like Ruisdael. The painting can be seen as a celebration of the Dutch Republic's achievements in trade and industry, as well as a reflection of the country's identity as a maritime power.
- Landownership: 
- independent farmers, not feudal lords (in France sengurial system, in England manorial system)
- Dutch Republic had a high percentage of land owned by peasants, which contributed to a more egalitarian society and a strong middle class. This contrasts with the feudal systems in France and England, where land was concentrated in the hands of the nobility, leading to greater social stratification and less economic mobility for peasants.
- sengurial system: a system of land ownership in which a lord (sengur) owned the land and peasants (serfs) worked it in exchange for protection and a portion of the produce. This system was prevalent in France during the medieval period and persisted into the early modern era.
- manorial system: a system of land ownership in which a lord owned a manor and the peasants (serfs) worked the land in exchange for protection and a portion of the produce. This system was prevalent in England during the medieval period and persisted into the early modern era.

### Still-Life Painting ✏️, Trade Routes, and Cultural Exchange in the Baroque Period

<!-- 

These included:

the India Run (the voyage made by the Portuguese between Lisbon and Goa, on the southwestern coast of India. from the 16th to the 19th centuries)
the Manila Galleon (maintained by Spain between 1565–1815 to bring Asian goods—including the Japanese lacquer works that Mexican artists embraced in enconchado paintings such as the one mentioned above—across the North Pacific from Manila in the Philippines to Acapulco in New Spain, now Mexico),
and the Dutch East and West India Companies (VOC and GWC), which monopolized trade with Eurasia and Southern Africa and with West Africa and the Americas, respectively, during much of the 17th and 18th centuries.
These routes and companies moved exotic luxury objects such as Indian and Chinese fabrics, lacquer furniture, ivory figurines, porcelain, and spices across all the known continents. But most were also involved in the slave trade, adding a brutal aspect to this early modern globalization in the thousands of Africans who were forced into slavery in Europe and the Americas.

## Willem Kalf (1619–1693)
Kalf was a student of Hendrik Pot, a painter of historical subjects, and probably also of the painter Cornelis Saftleven. His choice of still lifes as subject matter dates to a stay in Paris (late 1630s–1646). His early works depict kitchen interiors with such elements as gourds and pots and pans strewn on the floor. These early paintings are much different in character from his later, luxurious compositions featuring such expensive and extraordinary objects as goblets, pewter, Venetian glass, and Chinese porcelain atop a marble or tapestry-covered table. Though his still lifes followed an established formula, Kalf greatly enriched the genre with his use of simple composition, dark background, and acutely perceived highlights. In restraint and richness of texture, Kalf’s still lifes were seldom, if ever, matched.

The wealthy inhabitants of Amsterdam found Kalf’s work irresistible. His banquet pieces and lavish representations of fine objects were in great demand.

### paintin: A Review of the Global Baroqueg
The wealth of materials, techniques, and especially the countless artists, artisans, and craftsmen of various origins who contributed to the creation of this global Baroque can’t be overestimated. Think about how the desire for Chinese porcelain in the Dutch Republic drove the production of delftware (illustrated earlier), a domestic version of the coveted ware (and in turn how the Chinese created new types of ceramics for European markets), or how the “perfect red” attained with American cochineal dye became the color of royalty and nobility across Europe and the Americas.

### still life painting
Still-life painting emerged as a major genre in the Baroque period, particularly in the Dutch Republic, where artists like Pieter Claesz and Willem Kalf created intricate compositions featuring everyday objects, food, and luxury items. These paintings often carried symbolic meanings related to the transience of life (vanitas themes) and the wealth generated through global trade.

<!-- 

### Still Life with Fruit, Glassware, and a Wanli Bowl, 1659
- This painting by Willem Kalf features a luxurious arrangement of fruit, glassware, and a Wanli bowl, which was a type of Chinese porcelain highly prized in Europe during the 17th century. The inclusion of the Wanli bowl highlights the influence of global trade on Dutch art, as it reflects the demand for exotic goods from Asia. The painting also exemplifies the Baroque style with its dramatic lighting and rich textures, while also serving as a symbol of wealth and the transience of material possessions.

By the seventeenth century the Netherlands had become a prosperous country through its shipping trade across Europe and its trade links with Asia. The United Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) was formed in 1602 in order to unite various small trade companies which had created commercial links with the India and East Asia during the late sixteenth century. With bases in Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia, the Company became a powerful trade organization. It was even given powers of rule over its dominions, along similar lines to those of the English East India Company. Like its British rival, the Dutch East India Company issued coins for trade in its dominions. The coin bears the Company’s monogram (VOC) and the date.

- The demand for Chinese porcelain in the Dutch Republic led to the production of Delftware, a type of tin-glazed earthenware that imitated the blue and white porcelain imported from China. This reflects the influence of global trade on Dutch art and culture during the Baroque period, as European artists and consumers sought to incorporate exotic goods and styles into their work and daily lives.
- But in because of the shortage of silver, the Dutch also produced their own versions of Chinese porcelain, known as Delftware, which were made from tin-glazed earthenware and often featured blue and white designs inspired by Chinese motifs. This illustrates how global trade influenced not only the materials and objects depicted in Dutch art but also the production of art itself, as European artists adapted and reinterpreted foreign styles to meet local demand.

Claire Fargo: "I say “extra- European” rather than
“non- European” because in many cases, such as the examples discussed in
this chapter, the object produced outside Europe is already touched by European ideas. It is not exactly a non- European object. The approach used
here, developed to deal with just such complexities, considers the entire
arc of cultural production from point of origin to ultimate destination."

<!-- 

- Willem Claesz. Heda's Still Life with Glasses and Tobacco is a quintessential example of Dutch still life painting, showcasing the artist's mastery of light, texture, and composition. The painting features an array of objects, including glasses, a tobacco pipe, and a silver goblet, arranged on a table with a dark background. The meticulous attention to detail and the play of light on the surfaces of the objects create a sense of realism and depth. This painting not only reflects the material wealth of the Dutch Republic but also serves as a meditation on the fleeting nature of life and the transience of worldly possessions, themes commonly explored in Baroque art.
- The inclusion of tobacco in the painting is significant, as it was a luxury item that became popular in Europe during the 17th century, largely due to global trade. The presence of such items in still life paintings highlights the interconnectedness of European art with global commerce and the influence of exotic goods on European culture during the Baroque period.
- the venition glassware and silver goblet in the painting are indicative of the wealth and status of the Dutch middle class during the Golden Age. The meticulous depiction of these objects also reflects the influence of global trade, as many of the luxury items featured in Dutch still lifes were imported from Asia and other parts of the world, showcasing the reach and impact of global commerce on European art and society during this period.

![Juan Sánchez Cotán, Still Life with Quince, Cabbage, Melon, and Cucumber, c. 1602, oil on canvas](https://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cotan-EDITED.jpg)


<!-- 

Juan Sánchez Cotán’s Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber combines the hyper-realistic depiction of fruits and vegetables with the theatricality of staging these objects under dramatic lighting against a dark background, as well as an erudite classical reference: like most Baroque still life painters, Cotán was probably emulating the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis, who was known through written accounts for the deceptively illusionistic powers of his paintings.
- Cotán’s painting is a meditation on the transience of life and the inevitability of death, themes that were common in Baroque art. The stark contrast between the vibrant colors of the fruits and vegetables and the dark background creates a sense of drama and emphasizes the fleeting nature of beauty and life. The meticulous attention to detail in the depiction of the produce also reflects the influence of global trade, as these items were often exotic imports that symbolized wealth and status during the 17th century.
- Unlike the Dutch still lifes, which often included luxury items and symbols of wealth, Cotán's painting focuses on simple, everyday objects, elevating them to a level of significance and beauty. This approach reflects the Spanish Baroque's emphasis on spirituality and the contemplation of mortality, contrasting with the more materialistic themes found in Dutch still life paintings.


In fact, the gradual, emergent curvilinear plane has been compared to Archimedes’ hyperbola, suggesting that such paintings, which were generally made for an educated, secular clientele, were perhaps understood as geometric meditations.

Archimedes was first translated and published by Federico Commandino in 1565 (Archimedis De iis quae vehuntur in aqua libri duo/ a Frederico Commandino restituti et commentariis illustrate), at approximately the same time that he published his own De Centro Gravitatis. Commandino’s work was followed by Luca Valerio’s De Centro Gravitatis in 1604—confirming a strong contemporary interest in spherical bodies that might be related to Cotán’s still-life experiments.

Others have suggested that the arrangement of spheres and sectioned semi-spherical fruits and vegetables is to be understood in terms of astronomy, a representation of celestial bodies moving against the night sky, possibly in relation to celestial navigation. Spain was, of course, at the forefront of exploration in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Or, they could represent specific celestial bodies in their various phases, although Galileo did not turn his telescope toward the moon until 1609. Finally, all four of the items here were introduced from Europe for cultivation in the Americas, perhaps alluding, however obliquely, to Empire and conversion.

- The concept of the Wunderkammer, or Cabinet of Curiosities, emerged during the Renaissance and continued into the Baroque period as a way to collect and display a wide variety of objects that were considered rare, exotic, or scientifically significant. These cabinets often included natural specimens, artworks, artifacts from different cultures, and other curiosities that reflected the owner's interests and status. The frontispiece of Olaus Worm's Museum Wormianum illustrates the idea of a Wunderkammer, showcasing a diverse array of objects that represent the breadth of knowledge and curiosity during the 17th century. These collections served as microcosms of the world, allowing viewers to explore and learn about different cultures, natural phenomena, and artistic achievements in one space.
- By the mid- sixteenth century, these two objects might have been prize specimens in European collections, where they are still located today.

<!-- 

In 1539, the Nahua noble and gobernador (governor) of Mexico City, Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin (nephew and son-in-law to Moctezuma II, the last Aztec ruler before Spanish colonial rule began in 1521), commissioned a featherwork for Pope Paul III showing the Mass of St. Gregory. This artwork, made of different types of bird feathers attached to a wood panel, is remarkable for several reasons. Not only is it the oldest surviving featherwork from colonial Mexico, but it was made by an Indigenous man in order to be sent to the Pope during the early period of Spanish colonization. Two years before the featherwork’s creation, Pope Paul III had issued the bull Sublimus Dei that decreed Amerindian peoples to be rational human beings complete with souls, and called for an end to their enslavement.

The subject of the Mass of St. Gregory was popular at this time because of its focus on transubstantiation—the belief that the bread and wine transform into the body and blood of Christ during Mass. Saint Gregory was an important 6th-century pope, and one day during Mass he raised the consecrated host (the bread) and experienced a miraculous vision of Christ on the altar. His vision offered proof that the bread literally became Christ’s body when consecrated. Christ appeared to Saint Gregory as the Man of Sorrows—a type of image of Christ, where he is shown above the waist, with his wounds displayed on his hands and side.

<!-- 

The featherwork production of The Mass of Saint Gregory was likely supervised by the famous Franciscan missionary, Pedro de Gante, who came to the Viceroyalty of New Spain (the Spanish colonies in North America) from Flanders to aid in converting the native peoples to Christianity. He established a well-known school that trained Indigenous men in European artistic conventions and techniques. Prints were often supplied as models for these Christian neophytes. The featherwork represents the clash of different worlds—its technique is Mesoamerican, but the subject is European and Christian.

The instruments of the Passion of Christ (also known as the Arma Christi— specifically the instruments of Christ’s suffering, including the column, nails, sponge, cock, and flagellant whip) appear on or surrounding the altar in both van Meckenem’s print and the featherwork. Other colonial Mexican artworks—especially those used to aid in conversion of Indigenous populations—displayed passional instruments. On atrial crosses (crosses found in the courtyards, or atria, of missionary churches), for example, friars could point to the different Arma Christi as they taught native peoples about Christian dogma and biblical history.

<!-- 

Featherworks were among the most highly prized objects in the early post-Conquest period. Hernan Cortes sent feathered objects to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V to dazzle him with their richness and unique qualities. Others, like Diego de Soto, carried packages of featherworks from New Spain to Spain to give to Charles V soon after the Spanish Conquest. Many featherworks found their way into cabinets of curiosities throughout Europe, no doubt collected because they symbolized the exotic “New World” across the Atlantic. Still today, feathered goods like the so-called Headdress of Moctezuma are some of the most prized possessions of European museums.

Quetzal  feathers were especially prized, and the Codex Mendoza (a 16th-century Aztec codex created for Charles V) records the tribute paid in feathers to the Aztec emperor. The codex includes a detailed illustration of the different types of feathers that were collected and used for various purposes, such as ceremonial attire and featherwork art. The high value placed on feathers in Aztec society is evident in the elaborate feathered headdresses and other objects that were created using these materials, which were often reserved for nobility and important religious ceremonies.

We find many Indigenous groups used feathers to adorn luxury goods, festoon clothing, and function within ceremonies. The Mexica (more commonly known as the Aztecs), were among those groups who prized feathers. Through long-distance trade, the Aztecs acquired feathers from afar. The most highly prized feathers—those of the resplendent quetzal—came from Guatemala. Hummingbirds, macaws, and many other birds supplied feathers. The Mexica also collected feathers as tribute from areas they conquered. Tribute lists illustrated in the Codex Mendoza, produced after the Spanish Conquest, demonstrate the large number of birds and feathers sent to the Aztec capital city, Tenochtitlan. In Tenochtitlan, featherworkers comprised their own special social class. They lived in a neighborhood called Amantla, which is why they were called amanteca.

<!-- 

- Rembrandt's The Night Watch is a prime example of how art can serve as a form of mapping and representation of the world. The painting depicts a group of civic guardsmen, and through its composition, use of light and shadow, and attention to detail, it captures the social dynamics and cultural context of 17th-century Amsterdam. The painting can be seen as a visual map of the city's militia, reflecting the importance of civic duty and community in Dutch society during the Golden Age. The dynamic arrangement of the figures and the dramatic use of chiaroscuro also create a sense of movement and energy, further emphasizing the painting's role in representing the vibrancy of urban life in the Dutch Republic.
- ceremonial group portrait of a militia company, which was a common subject in Dutch art during the 17th century. 
- civic prides
- elite citizen (pay to be part of the militia, and to be in the painting)
- - The painting was originally intended to be a traditional group portrait of the militia company, but Rembrandt's innovative composition and use of light and shadow created a dynamic and dramatic scene that broke away from the conventions of the time. The painting's title, "The Night Watch," is actually a misnomer, as it was originally called "The Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banning Cocq." The painting depicts the militia company in action, with figures moving in various directions and engaging in different activities, creating a sense of movement and energy that was unprecedented in group portraits of the era. The Night Watch is now considered one of Rembrandt's masterpieces and a symbol of Dutch art and culture during the Golden Age.
- **Captain Frans Banning Cocq and his lieutenant**, Willem van Ruytenburch, are prominently featured in the foreground, dressed in black and red, respectively. The other members of the militia are depicted in various poses and attire, creating a sense of individuality and character within the group. The painting's composition and use of light draw attention to the central figures while also highlighting the diversity and camaraderie among the militia members. The Night Watch can be seen as a visual representation of the social hierarchy and civic pride of Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age, as well as a celebration of the city's military and civic institutions.

<!-- 
- in depicting the militia company, Rembrandt included a variety of characters, such as musketeers and a drummer, who are shown in action, adding to the dynamic nature of the painting. The musketeer in red stands out with his vibrant attire, while the musketeer with the oak leaves helmet adds a touch of symbolism, as oak leaves were often associated with strength and victory. The musketeer blowing off powder captures a moment of action and movement, further emphasizing the lively atmosphere of the scene. These details contribute to the overall narrative of the painting, showcasing the diversity and camaraderie among the militia members while also highlighting their roles and identities within the group.
- the girl in the background, often referred to as the "little girl," is a mysterious figure in the painting. She is believed to be a symbolic representation of the militia's mascot or a personification of the company itself. The little girl is depicted wearing a yellow dress and holding a chicken, which is thought to be a reference to the emblem of the militia company. Her presence adds an element of intrigue and symbolism to the painting, as she stands out from the rest of the figures and draws the viewer's attention.

<!-- 
- Frans Hals' Banquet of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard is a group portrait that depicts the members of a civic guard company in a banquet setting. The painting captures the camaraderie and social dynamics of the militia, with figures engaged in conversation and celebration. The composition is more static compared to Rembrandt's Night Watch, with the officers arranged in a more traditional manner around a table. The use of light and color in Hals' painting creates a lively and festive atmosphere, while Rembrandt's Night Watch employs dramatic lighting and a more dynamic composition to convey a sense of action and movement. Both paintings serve as visual representations of the civic pride and social structure of Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age, but they do so through different artistic approaches and styles.

<!-- 

- it was commissioned by the Amsterdam Guild of Surgeons to commemorate Dr. Tulp's appointment as the guild's official anatomist. The painting serves as a visual representation of the guild's commitment to advancing medical knowledge and education, as well as a testament to Dr. Tulp's expertise and influence in the field of anatomy during the Dutch Golden Age.
- The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp is a group portrait that depicts Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, a prominent Amsterdam physician, demonstrating a dissection to a group of surgeons. The painting captures the scientific and intellectual atmosphere of the Dutch Golden Age, showcasing the importance of medical knowledge and education during this period. The composition is carefully arranged, with Dr. Tulp positioned at the center, drawing attention to his role as the instructor. The other figures are engaged in observing the dissection, creating a sense of focus and concentration. The use of light and shadow adds depth and drama to the scene, emphasizing the significance of the moment being depicted. The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp is not only a celebration of scientific inquiry but also a reflection of the social status and prestige associated with the medical profession in 17th-century Amsterdam.

Rembrandt’s almost obsessive relationship with his own visage could be viewed as a process of self-exploration, a way he took stock of who he was at different points in his career. In some ways, this might seem consistent with the seventeenth-century Calvinist mindset within which Rembrandt would have been raised, a mindset that advocated intense personal responsibility for the state of one’s own soul.

- the typical rambrandt self-portraits in pose: one hand placed on a table or plantform the torso turned slightly to the side, and the head turned toward the viewer. The pose is relaxed and informal, with the artist looking directly at the viewer with a calm and confident expression. The composition is simple, with Rembrandt and Saskia positioned in the center of the image, surrounded by a dark background that emphasizes their faces and clothing. The use of light and shadow adds depth and dimension to the etching, creating a sense of intimacy and immediacy in the portrayal of the couple. This self-portrait is a testament to Rembrandt's skill as an artist and his ability to capture the essence of his subjects with great sensitivity and nuance.
- elbow on the table, torso turned slightly to the side, and head turned toward the viewer. This pose is a common feature in Rembrandt's self-portraits, as it allows him to engage directly with the viewer while also creating a sense of depth and dimension in the composition. The relaxed and informal nature of the pose also reflects Rembrandt's approach to self-portraiture, which often emphasized a candid and introspective portrayal of himself rather than a formal or idealized image.

An old man in a white cap stares out at the viewer with a penetrating gaze. His left hand holds his hastily painted palette, brushes and maulstick, while his right hand seems to disappear in an unresolved blur into his thigh or the folds of his coat. He wears a red bib over a white shirt, with a fur lined coat on his shoulders. Some viewers perceive a gold chain, usually a mark of high honor, tucked into the folds of his garments.

The right edge of the canvas reveals the edge of the painting the artist is working on, while the back wall is adorned with two enigmatic arcing lines. The painting is not signed and is most likely unfinished. Technical studies suggest that it may have originally been slightly larger, which would have made the painting within the painting more prominent.

This is Rembrandt in the early 1660s —late in his career and during a period when he used thick impasto and dark colors to build up complex and engaging works of art. Scholars have regarded this particular self-portrait, one of many from the last decade of his life, as perhaps the most enigmatic and masterful of them all. It stands out from approximately 80 other self-portraits because of its light-toned background, which emphasizes the strangeness of the two circles that arc across the wall.

- she got into the guild (st. Luke’s Guild) in 1633, which was a significant achievement for a female artist at the time, as it allowed her to sell her work and take on apprentices. Her self-portrait, painted around 1630, is a testament to her skill and confidence as an artist. In the painting, Leyster is depicted holding a paintbrush and palette, with a lively expression on her face. The composition is dynamic, with Leyster positioned slightly off-center and looking directly at the viewer, which was a common pose for self-portraits during the Dutch Golden Age. The use of light and shadow adds depth and dimension to the painting, highlighting Leyster's features and creating a sense of intimacy. This self-portrait not only showcases Leyster's talent but also serves as a statement of her identity as a professional artist

Artists like Johannes Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch created intimate and detailed portrayals of domestic interiors, capturing moments of daily life with a sense of realism and warmth. These paintings often included subtle symbolism and reflected the values and social dynamics of the time, such as the importance of family, domesticity, and the emerging middle class. Genre paintings served as a visual representation of the world around them, offering viewers a glimpse into the lives of ordinary people during the 17th century.

-  in the 18th cent, Vermeer was felt off fashion and his work was not widely known. But in the 19th century, he was rediscovered by art critics and collectors, and his paintings became highly sought after. Today, Vermeer is considered one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age, and his works are celebrated for their exquisite detail, use of light, and ability to capture the quiet beauty of everyday life.

### Camera Obscura
It was a device that projected an image of the outside world onto a surface inside a darkened room or box. It was used by artists like Vermeer to achieve accurate perspective and lighting in their paintings. The camera obscura allowed artists to trace the projected image, helping them to create more realistic and detailed works of art.

- Art historians have found documentation that this was a historical figure, somebody who actually lived in Haarlem at this time. She was in fact committed to the city of Haarlem’s insane asylum.
-  The owl comes from a Dutch expression, “To be as drunk as an owl,” but also a reference to the idea of night, and perhaps also a reference to Malle Babbe’s nickname, which referred to her as a witch, and of course, the owl, a signifier of witchcraft.
-  It’s interesting to know biographically that the artist Frans Hals’ son was also committed there with her. So it seems that the artist was perhaps inspired to explore madness in this very direct way.
- You know, the 17th century in Holland was this moment when painting becomes modern, in that it begins to fulfill its potential to represent humanity in all of its facets. No longer is painting relegated to the religious, no longer is painting relegated to the royal portrait. There is this attention now to some of the complications that make us human.
