![17th-century Dutch Dejima, Japan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/DutchDejima.png)

<!-- 
In the court of Shah Suleiman I, the Safavid ruler of Iran, we see a scene of cultural exchange and global trade. The presence of European-style clothing and the depiction of foreign visitors suggest the influence of global trade routes and interactions with European powers during the 17th century.

Dejima (Japanese: 出島; lit. 'exit island') or Deshima,[a] in the 17th century also called Tsukishima (築島; lit. 'built island'), was an artificial island off Nagasaki, Japan, that served as a trading post for the Portuguese (1570–1639) and subsequently the Dutch (1641–1858).[1] For 220 years, it was the central conduit for foreign trade and cultural exchange with Japan during the isolationist Edo period (1600–1869), and the only Japanese territory open to Westerners

- the dutch were the only westerners allowed to trade with Japan during the Edo period, and they were confined to Dejima, an artificial island in Nagasaki harbor. This limited contact allowed for a unique cultural exchange, where Dutch goods and knowledge influenced Japanese art, science, and technology, while Japanese culture also left its mark on Dutch art and fashion.

- the dutch are recognizable in the painting by their distinctive clothing, which includes wide-brimmed hats, doublets, and breeches. The presence of these foreign figures in the Safavid court highlights the interconnectedness of global trade networks during the 17th century and the cultural exchanges that occurred as a result of these interactions.

### Landscape Painting ✏️ as Mapping the World

<br>

### The word "landscape" entered the modern English language as _landskip_ (variously _spelt_), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works ofart, with its first use as a word for a painting in 1598.

<!-- Landscape painting in the Baroque period often served as a way to map and represent the world, reflecting the expanding horizons of European exploration and colonization. Artists like Jacob van Ruisdael and Aelbert Cuyp depicted vast, detailed landscapes that not only showcased the beauty of nature but also symbolized the growing knowledge and control over the environment. These paintings often included elements such as ships, exotic flora and fauna, and distant horizons, which conveyed a sense of discovery and the global reach of European powers during this era. -->

<!-- 

- Andries Beeckman's The Castle of Batavia depicts the Dutch colonial presence in Indonesia, showcasing the architecture and bustling activity of the port city. The painting serves as a visual record of Dutch imperialism and the global trade networks that connected Europe to Asia during the 17th century.

### Franz Post
From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch colony in northern Brazil, appropriated from the Portuguese, forcibly dispossessed Indigenous populations of their land. Post and a naturalist accompanied the governor to the area and recorded flora and fauna (such as the foreground iguana). The landscapes he produced after returning home mix observation with fantasy. Post’s painting hides the process by which natural resources were obtained. Absent are obvious references to the enslavement of African people and their forced labor on plantations, the basis of Dutch colonial wealth. Indigenous families appear at rest, apparently after hunting and food gathering. Routinely treated as generic figures in Dutch representations, Indigenous Brazilian groups include the Aymoré, Potiguara, Tarairiu, and Tupinambá, among others.

<!-- 


Portuguese traders had first introduced sugarcane to the Americas in the 1500s. Portugal had pioneered the plantation system in the Atlantic islands of Madeira and São Tomé, and because the sugar produced from Brazilian plantations was used for an export market, this necessitated land that could be acquired with little conflict from existing occupants. By the sixteenth century, sugarcane plantations had been developed along the northeast coast of Brazil, and the sugar produced from these plantations became the basis of the Brazilian economy and society. By 1570, Brazil's sugar output rivaled that of the Atlantic islands.

At first, the settlers tried to enslave the native peoples to work the sugarcane fields, but this proved to be difficult, so they turned to using slaves instead. Slave labor was the driving force behind the growth of the sugar economy in Brazil, and sugar was the primary export of the colony from 1600 to 1650.

In the mid-seventeenth century, the Dutch seized productive areas of northeast Brazil, and because the Dutch were expelled from Brazil, following a strong push by Portuguese-Brazilians and their indigenous and Afro-Brazilian allies, Dutch sugar production became the model for Brazilian sugar production in the Caribbean. Increased production and competition meant that the price of sugar dropped, and Brazil's market share dropped. However, Brazil's recovery from the Dutch incursion was slow, as warfare had taken its toll on the sugar plantations.

<!--
- Jacob van Ruisdael's View of Haarlem with Bleaching Grounds depicts the Dutch landscape and the process of bleaching linen, which was an important industry in the Netherlands. The painting reflects the economic prosperity of the Dutch Golden Age and the connection between art and commerce during this period.
- The painting also serves as a metaphor for the Dutch Republic's global reach and influence, as the bleaching grounds can be seen as a symbol of the country's ability to transform raw materials into valuable commodities through trade and industry. The expansive sky and distant horizon in the painting evoke a sense of openness and possibility, mirroring the opportunities presented by global trade and exploration during the 17th century.
- Compared to the other European nations, the Dutch peseats were relatively wealthy, and the country had a high standard of living. This economic prosperity was largely due to the success of Dutch trade and commerce, which allowed for a flourishing art market and the patronage of artists like Ruisdael. The painting can be seen as a celebration of the Dutch Republic's achievements in trade and industry, as well as a reflection of the country's identity as a maritime power.
- Landownership: 
- independent farmers, not feudal lords (in France sengurial system, in England manorial system)
- Dutch Republic had a high percentage of land owned by peasants, which contributed to a more egalitarian society and a strong middle class. This contrasts with the feudal systems in France and England, where land was concentrated in the hands of the nobility, leading to greater social stratification and less economic mobility for peasants.
- sengurial system: a system of land ownership in which a lord (sengur) owned the land and peasants (serfs) worked it in exchange for protection and a portion of the produce. This system was prevalent in France during the medieval period and persisted into the early modern era.
- manorial system: a system of land ownership in which a lord owned a manor and the peasants (serfs) worked the land in exchange for protection and a portion of the produce. This system was prevalent in England during the medieval period and persisted into the early modern era.

### Still-Life Painting ✏️, Trade Routes, and Cultural Exchange in the Baroque Period

<!-- 

These included:

the India Run (the voyage made by the Portuguese between Lisbon and Goa, on the southwestern coast of India. from the 16th to the 19th centuries)
the Manila Galleon (maintained by Spain between 1565–1815 to bring Asian goods—including the Japanese lacquer works that Mexican artists embraced in enconchado paintings such as the one mentioned above—across the North Pacific from Manila in the Philippines to Acapulco in New Spain, now Mexico),
and the Dutch East and West India Companies (VOC and GWC), which monopolized trade with Eurasia and Southern Africa and with West Africa and the Americas, respectively, during much of the 17th and 18th centuries.
These routes and companies moved exotic luxury objects such as Indian and Chinese fabrics, lacquer furniture, ivory figurines, porcelain, and spices across all the known continents. But most were also involved in the slave trade, adding a brutal aspect to this early modern globalization in the thousands of Africans who were forced into slavery in Europe and the Americas.

## Willem Kalf (1619–1693)
Kalf was a student of Hendrik Pot, a painter of historical subjects, and probably also of the painter Cornelis Saftleven. His choice of still lifes as subject matter dates to a stay in Paris (late 1630s–1646). His early works depict kitchen interiors with such elements as gourds and pots and pans strewn on the floor. These early paintings are much different in character from his later, luxurious compositions featuring such expensive and extraordinary objects as goblets, pewter, Venetian glass, and Chinese porcelain atop a marble or tapestry-covered table. Though his still lifes followed an established formula, Kalf greatly enriched the genre with his use of simple composition, dark background, and acutely perceived highlights. In restraint and richness of texture, Kalf’s still lifes were seldom, if ever, matched.

The wealthy inhabitants of Amsterdam found Kalf’s work irresistible. His banquet pieces and lavish representations of fine objects were in great demand.

### paintin: A Review of the Global Baroqueg
The wealth of materials, techniques, and especially the countless artists, artisans, and craftsmen of various origins who contributed to the creation of this global Baroque can’t be overestimated. Think about how the desire for Chinese porcelain in the Dutch Republic drove the production of delftware (illustrated earlier), a domestic version of the coveted ware (and in turn how the Chinese created new types of ceramics for European markets), or how the “perfect red” attained with American cochineal dye became the color of royalty and nobility across Europe and the Americas.

### still life painting
Still-life painting emerged as a major genre in the Baroque period, particularly in the Dutch Republic, where artists like Pieter Claesz and Willem Kalf created intricate compositions featuring everyday objects, food, and luxury items. These paintings often carried symbolic meanings related to the transience of life (vanitas themes) and the wealth generated through global trade.

<!-- 

### Still Life with Fruit, Glassware, and a Wanli Bowl, 1659
- This painting by Willem Kalf features a luxurious arrangement of fruit, glassware, and a Wanli bowl, which was a type of Chinese porcelain highly prized in Europe during the 17th century. The inclusion of the Wanli bowl highlights the influence of global trade on Dutch art, as it reflects the demand for exotic goods from Asia. The painting also exemplifies the Baroque style with its dramatic lighting and rich textures, while also serving as a symbol of wealth and the transience of material possessions.

<!-- 

By the seventeenth century the Netherlands had become a prosperous country through its shipping trade across Europe and its trade links with Asia. The United Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie) was formed in 1602 in order to unite various small trade companies which had created commercial links with the India and East Asia during the late sixteenth century. With bases in Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia, the Company became a powerful trade organization. It was even given powers of rule over its dominions, along similar lines to those of the English East India Company. Like its British rival, the Dutch East India Company issued coins for trade in its dominions. The coin bears the Company’s monogram (VOC) and the date.

![Juan Sánchez Cotán, Still Life with Quince, Cabbage, Melon, and Cucumber, c. 1602, oil on canvas](https://smarthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Cotan-EDITED.jpg)


<!-- 

Juan Sánchez Cotán’s Quince, Cabbage, Melon and Cucumber combines the hyper-realistic depiction of fruits and vegetables with the theatricality of staging these objects under dramatic lighting against a dark background, as well as an erudite classical reference: like most Baroque still life painters, Cotán was probably emulating the ancient Greek painter Zeuxis, who was known through written accounts for the deceptively illusionistic powers of his paintings.
- Cotán’s painting is a meditation on the transience of life and the inevitability of death, themes that were common in Baroque art. The stark contrast between the vibrant colors of the fruits and vegetables and the dark background creates a sense of drama and emphasizes the fleeting nature of beauty and life. The meticulous attention to detail in the depiction of the produce also reflects the influence of global trade, as these items were often exotic imports that symbolized wealth and status during the 17th century.
- Unlike the Dutch still lifes, which often included luxury items and symbols of wealth, Cotán's painting focuses on simple, everyday objects, elevating them to a level of significance and beauty. This approach reflects the Spanish Baroque's emphasis on spirituality and the contemplation of mortality, contrasting with the more materialistic themes found in Dutch still life paintings.

<!-- 

- Rembrandt's The Night Watch is a prime example of how art can serve as a form of mapping and representation of the world. The painting depicts a group of civic guardsmen, and through its composition, use of light and shadow, and attention to detail, it captures the social dynamics and cultural context of 17th-century Amsterdam. The painting can be seen as a visual map of the city's militia, reflecting the importance of civic duty and community in Dutch society during the Golden Age. The dynamic arrangement of the figures and the dramatic use of chiaroscuro also create a sense of movement and energy, further emphasizing the painting's role in representing the vibrancy of urban life in the Dutch Republic.
- ceremonial group portrait of a militia company, which was a common subject in Dutch art during the 17th century. 
- civic prides
- elite citizen (pay to be part of the militia, and to be in the painting)
- - The painting was originally intended to be a traditional group portrait of the militia company, but Rembrandt's innovative composition and use of light and shadow created a dynamic and dramatic scene that broke away from the conventions of the time. The painting's title, "The Night Watch," is actually a misnomer, as it was originally called "The Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banning Cocq." The painting depicts the militia company in action, with figures moving in various directions and engaging in different activities, creating a sense of movement and energy that was unprecedented in group portraits of the era. The Night Watch is now considered one of Rembrandt's masterpieces and a symbol of Dutch art and culture during the Golden Age.
- **Captain Frans Banning Cocq and his lieutenant**, Willem van Ruytenburch, are prominently featured in the foreground, dressed in black and red, respectively. The other members of the militia are depicted in various poses and attire, creating a sense of individuality and character within the group. The painting's composition and use of light draw attention to the central figures while also highlighting the diversity and camaraderie among the militia members. The Night Watch can be seen as a visual representation of the social hierarchy and civic pride of Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age, as well as a celebration of the city's military and civic institutions.

<!-- 
- in depicting the militia company, Rembrandt included a variety of characters, such as musketeers and a drummer, who are shown in action, adding to the dynamic nature of the painting. The musketeer in red stands out with his vibrant attire, while the musketeer with the oak leaves helmet adds a touch of symbolism, as oak leaves were often associated with strength and victory. The musketeer blowing off powder captures a moment of action and movement, further emphasizing the lively atmosphere of the scene. These details contribute to the overall narrative of the painting, showcasing the diversity and camaraderie among the militia members while also highlighting their roles and identities within the group.
- the girl in the background, often referred to as the "little girl," is a mysterious figure in the painting. She is believed to be a symbolic representation of the militia's mascot or a personification of the company itself. The little girl is depicted wearing a yellow dress and holding a chicken, which is thought to be a reference to the emblem of the militia company. Her presence adds an element of intrigue and symbolism to the painting, as she stands out from the rest of the figures and draws the viewer's attention.

<!-- 
- Frans Hals' Banquet of the Officers of the St George Civic Guard is a group portrait that depicts the members of a civic guard company in a banquet setting. The painting captures the camaraderie and social dynamics of the militia, with figures engaged in conversation and celebration. The composition is more static compared to Rembrandt's Night Watch, with the officers arranged in a more traditional manner around a table. The use of light and color in Hals' painting creates a lively and festive atmosphere, while Rembrandt's Night Watch employs dramatic lighting and a more dynamic composition to convey a sense of action and movement. Both paintings serve as visual representations of the civic pride and social structure of Amsterdam during the Dutch Golden Age, but they do so through different artistic approaches and styles.

- the lady in blue is Clio, the muse of history, who holds a trumpet and a book, symbols of fame and knowledge. The map on the back wall is a map of the Netherlands, which was a common motif in Dutch Golden Age paintings and often symbolized national pride and identity.
- Look at the curtain that’s been drawn back, that takes up the top quarter of the painting. We’re looking at a scene that we don’t normally get to see.
-  Look at the artist. He’s dressed up too. He’s dressed up the model, but he’s wearing something fancier than the artist would traditionally wear in the studio. This black vest that has these openings and slits in it, and this really nice hat. The bright orange leggings.
-  in the 18th cent, Vermeer was felt off fashion and his work was not widely known. But in the 19th century, he was rediscovered by art critics and collectors, and his paintings became highly sought after. Today, Vermeer is considered one of the greatest painters of the Dutch Golden Age, and his works are celebrated for their exquisite detail, use of light, and ability to capture the quiet beauty of everyday life.
-  hitler bought the painting in 1940, and it was displayed in the Führermuseum in Linz, Austria. After World War II, the painting was recovered by the Allies and returned to the Netherlands. It is now housed in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, Austria.

### Camera Obscura
It was a device that projected an image of the outside world onto a surface inside a darkened room or box. It was used by artists like Vermeer to achieve accurate perspective and lighting in their paintings. The camera obscura allowed artists to trace the projected image, helping them to create more realistic and detailed works of art.
