### FOUR PILLARS OF ART HISTORY
<br>

1. <span v-mark.red>**Formal analysis**</span> (meaning and other effects produced by color, shape, texture, scale, line, shadow, space, composition and other physical properties of the work itself)
2. <span v-mark.red>**Iconographic analysis**</span> (story, theme or subject presented by the work including any
symbolism or veiled meanings that would be legible to contemporaries of the artist)
3. <span v-mark.red>**Sociohistorical analysis**</span> (social, political, economic and cultural context in which the
work is produced)
4. <span v-mark.red>**Aesthetic analysis**</span> (sensuous, psychological and social-psychological impact that the
work has on you and others)

<!-- 

### Formal Analysis
- it is not a description: A description simply lists what is seen in the artwork but unlike formal analysis, it does not offer inference, and it does not evaluate.

<!-- 

one thing that sets formal analysis apart from description is that it offers an argument (often cause-and-effect) about how the formal elements of the work function to create meaning or effect.

<!-- 

This myth was often included in proverb anthologies of the time, as an illustration of the folly of pride and ambition. Bruegel conveyed this moral in an ingenious manner. The flight of Icarus has been miraculous. However, it causes barely a ripple in the tide of human affairs: the plowman and the shepherd go about their daily business, while the ship passes by, without noticing the drowning boy. Similarly, a casual spectator, unaware of the painting’s title, might easily fail to spot the legs of Icarus, in the lower right-hand corner of the picture. Bruegel underlined the moral with other details. The shepherd, as careless as Icarus, is daydreaming, while his sheep wander off into the sea. On the ground, a wallet and sword refer to a popular proverb: “A sword and money need careful hands.” In addition, there is a corpse in the thicket on the left, illustrating the saying: “No plow stops because a man dies.”

### What Is Style?

<br>
"the features of a book, painting, building, etc. that make it typical of a particular author, artist, historical period, etc." 

<br>

\- Oxford English Dictionary {.text-xs .mt-8}

<!-- 
meanings of style:
1. the particular way in which something is done
2.  a particular design of something, especially clothes
3.  the quality of being fashionable in the clothes that you wear (like saying "Some people have no sense of style." or "That outfit is very stylish." or "They have a sense of style.") or
4.  the quality of being attractive and made or done to a high standard ("The hotel has been redecorated but it's lost a lot of its style.")

## Fan Kuan, Travelers by Streams and Mountains

Daoist mountain man, hermit, rustic, wine-lover—Fan Kuan has the reputation of having been truly unconventional. We know very little about this great artist, yet he painted the most majestic landscape painting of the early Song period. Everything about Travelers by Streams and Mountains, which is possibly the only surviving work by Fan Kuan, is an orderly statement reflecting the artist’s worldview.

Bounded by mountain ranges and bisected by two great rivers—the Yellow and the Yangtze—China’s natural landscape has played an important role in the shaping of the Chinese mind and character. From very early times, the Chinese viewed mountains as sacred and imagined them as the abode of immortals. The term for landscape painting (shanshui hua) in Chinese is translated as “mountain water painting.”

<!-- 

Perugino was a leading artist in both Florence and his native Perugia and his influence on Raphael’s early paintings is unmistakable. Recent scholarship however, suggests that Raphael’s associations with Perugino came a bit later, his early training continuing in the family workshop even after his father’s death in 1494.

An altarpiece depicting the Marriage of the Virgin (1504) shows Raphael’s indebtedness to Perugino’s approach as well as his departure from the master’s style. A comparison with a contemporaneous work on the same subject by Perugino is telling. The compositions are similar, with ready parallels evident between the placement of figures and the use of architecture. Yet Raphael’s space is more pronounced, his architecture more monumental, and his figures are imbued with a greater vitality.

### Raphael's Portrait of Maddalena Doni

The Portrait of Agnolo Doni, Maddalena's husband and a rich cloth merchant, was made by Raphael at the same time. 


### Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa

Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo , known as the Mona Lisa, is Leonardo da Vinci’s most famous painting. They were married in 1495 when she was 15 years old. The painting was probably commissioned by her husband to celebrate either the birth of their second son or the purchase of a new home. 
Giocondo was a wealthy silk merchant and a government official in Florence and Lisa came from a well-to-do family.


#### Leomnardo's Innovations in the Mona Lisa

1. Use of Sfumato (the technique of allowing tones and colors to shade gradually into one another, producing softened outlines or hazy forms)
(from Italian sfumare, “to tone down” or “to evaporate like smoke”)
