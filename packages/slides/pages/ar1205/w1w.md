### FOUR PILLARS OF ART HISTORY
<br>

1. <span v-mark.red>**Formal analysis**</span> (meaning and other effects produced by color, shape, texture, scale, line, shadow, space, composition and other physical properties of the work itself)
2. <span v-mark.red>**Iconographic analysis**</span> (story, theme or subject presented by the work including any
symbolism or veiled meanings that would be legible to contemporaries of the artist)
3. <span v-mark.red>**Sociohistorical analysis**</span> (social, political, economic and cultural context in which the
work is produced)
4. <span v-mark.red>**Aesthetic analysis**</span> (sensuous, psychological and social-psychological impact that the
work has on you and others)

<!-- 

### Formal Analysis
- it is not a description: A description simply lists what is seen in the artwork but unlike formal analysis, it does not offer inference, and it does not evaluate.

#### "The surface below the eyes and cheecks are sensitively modeled to suggest the soft fleshy form of age."
</StickyNote>

<!-- 

one thing that sets formal analysis apart from description is that it offers an argument (often cause-and-effect) about how the formal elements of the work function to create meaning or effect.

CONNECT EFFECT TO CAUSE to show how described object works.

### What Is Style?

<br>
"the features of a book, painting, building, etc. that make it typical of a particular author, artist, historical period, etc." 

<br>

\- Oxford English Dictionary {.text-xs .mt-8}

<!-- 
meanings of style:
1. the particular way in which something is done
2.  a particular design of something, especially clothes
3.  the quality of being fashionable in the clothes that you wear (like saying "Some people have no sense of style." or "That outfit is very stylish." or "They have a sense of style.") or
4.  the quality of being attractive and made or done to a high standard ("The hotel has been redecorated but it's lost a lot of its style.")
