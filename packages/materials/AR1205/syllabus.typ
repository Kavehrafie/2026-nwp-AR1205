= Calendar Description

The course examines art from the 15th century to the 20th century, focusing on various art forms with examples from both the non-Western and Western canons. It includes case studies from diverse regions, which explore a range of different forms of expression. This course will familiarize students with basic terms and concepts used in discussing art and cultural artifacts.
